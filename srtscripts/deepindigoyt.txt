The scenery doesn’t change;
0:02
on a faded afternoon I’m lying in the deep indigo
0:05
beneath the overpass
0:10
I hear a single clap
0:12
for my blank-page life
0:14
I was singing about my own emptiness today, as usual

So things wouldn’t change,
0:39
I wrote a story starring you
0:42
in my notebook
0:46
My gas and water being cut off,
0:48
society, and the news are all someone else’s problem
0:51
Look,
0:53
my life is like ink
0:54
The dream I had when I was young gets closer to its expiration date
1:05
as I get older
1:07
Though I just, I just look up at the clouds
1:11
As usual, they flow through my field of vision
1:16
In the distant night sky I looked up at, flowers swam
1:20
So many that it could be mistaken for spring
1:24
As if I’d just lost sight of you
1:28
Translation by EJ/bluepenguin
1:32
*A more literal translation of the title would be “Indigo Squared.”
1:36
The word for “indigo,” 藍/ai, sounds like the number “i,”;
1:40
i2 is -1.
1:42
It’s also homophonous with 愛 (love) and 哀 (grief).
1:46
I looked down so I wouldn’t trip
1:49
Life is made of
1:50
nothing but compromises
1:55
I don’t believe in hearts or fate or love songs or life
1:59
After all, if you can’t sell something it has no value
2:03
I intentionally discarded the present I dreamed of,
2:08
and now I’m lying here waiting for
2:13
its expiration date
2:15
Behind my eyelids, I just, I just saw
2:20
An imagined, distant vision of you
2:24
In my notebook, flowers swim in the corner of a faded night
2:29
One more is in my eye
2:33
Life is just one compromise after another**
2:36
I learned that pretty fast
2:38
Elma, it’s you
2:41
You alone are my music
2:43
There are only eighty more characters in this song
2:46
Because maybe the only value of a life
2:49
is in the way it ends
2:56
I just, I just picture you
3:01
As even the indigo filling my vision is blurred
3:05
In the distant sky I looked up at, flowers swam
3:10
Deep indigo covers my eyes
3:15
It’s just, it’s just…
3:24
In the distant sky I looked up at, you are cooling off
3:33
As if you were just swimming in the night
