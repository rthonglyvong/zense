1
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:40,756
The scenery doesn’t change; on a faded afternoon

2
00:02:41,443 --> 00:02:46,892
I’m lying in the deep indigo beneath the overpass

3
00:02:49,155 --> 00:02:53,860
I hear a single clap for my blank-page life

4
00:02:54,732 --> 00:03:00,491
I was singing about my own emptiness today, as usual

5
00:03:20,979 --> 00:03:22,003
So things wouldn’t change,

6
00:03:22,827 --> 00:03:29,283
I wrote a story starring you in my notebook

7
00:03:31,307 --> 00:03:36,691
My gas and water being cut off, society, and the news are all someone else’s problem

8
00:03:37,883 --> 00:03:39,620
Look, my life is like ink

9
00:03:40,387 --> 00:03:53,228
The dream I had when I was young gets closer to its expiration date as I get older

10
00:03:53,587 --> 00:03:58,539
Though I just, I just look up at the clouds

11
00:03:58,908 --> 00:04:03,435
As usual, they flow through my field of vision

12
00:04:04,275 --> 00:04:08,627
In the distant night sky I looked up at, flowers swam

13
00:04:09,251 --> 00:04:12,891
So many that it could be mistaken for spring

14
00:04:13,396 --> 00:04:17,820
As if I’d just lost sight of you

15
00:04:37,708 --> 00:04:40,315
I looked down so I wouldn’t trip

16
00:04:40,916 --> 00:04:45,467
Life is made of nothing but compromises

17
00:04:47,884 --> 00:04:52,204
I don’t believe in hearts or fate or love songs or life

18
00:04:52,868 --> 00:04:55,388
After all, if you can’t sell something it has no value

19
00:04:56,747 --> 00:05:09,708
I intentionally discarded the present I dreamed of, and now I’m lying here waiting for its expiration date

20
00:05:10,075 --> 00:05:14,803
Behind my eyelids, I just, I just saw

21
00:05:15,172 --> 00:05:19,532
An imagined, distant vision of you

22
00:05:20,348 --> 00:05:24,707
In my notebook, flowers swim in the corner of a faded night

23
00:05:25,540 --> 00:05:28,267
One more is in my eye

24
00:05:30,468 --> 00:05:33,075
Life is just one compromise after another

25
00:05:33,315 --> 00:05:35,451
I learned that pretty fast

26
00:05:35,708 --> 00:05:36,891
Elma, it’s you

27
00:05:38,515 --> 00:05:40,283
You alone are my music

28
00:05:41,388 --> 00:05:43,811
There are only eighty more characters in this song

29
00:05:44,311 --> 00:05:50,892
Because maybe the only value of a life is in the way it ends

30
00:05:55,668 --> 00:05:59,851
I just, I just picture you

31
00:06:00,851 --> 00:06:04,451
As even the indigo filling my vision is blurred

32
00:06:05,380 --> 00:06:09,700
In the distant sky I looked up at, flowers swam

33
00:06:10,332 --> 00:06:13,659
Deep indigo covers my eyes

34
00:06:15,187 --> 00:06:18,996
It’s just, it’s just…

35
00:06:25,716 --> 00:06:30,283
In the distant sky I looked up at, you are cooling off

36
00:06:35,172 --> 00:06:38,923
As if you were just swimming in the night

37
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:33,267
I’ve thought about it, but I still don’t understand

38
00:07:33,955 --> 00:07:35,467
Under the blue sky, I waited for you

39
00:07:36,052 --> 00:07:38,692
On that breezy afternoon, my imagination escaped the confines of the day

40
00:07:39,036 --> 00:07:41,076
Hey, where do I go from here?

41
00:07:41,636 --> 00:07:43,091
No one has told me how to proceed

42
00:07:43,715 --> 00:07:46,724
I looked into your eyes and without a word I walked away

43
00:08:03,316 --> 00:08:04,755
I’ve thought about it, but I still don’t understand

44
00:08:05,219 --> 00:08:06,660
Youth is so boring

45
00:08:07,148 --> 00:08:10,419
I tried to give up piano, but I can’t break the habit of playing on my desk*

46
00:08:10,748 --> 00:08:12,500
Hey, what will I do in the future?

47
00:08:12,851 --> 00:08:14,411
It shouldn’t be music, right?

48
00:08:16,596 --> 00:08:17,355
Don’t worry

49
00:08:17,987 --> 00:08:25,779
Even if I plucked a single string in my heart

50
00:08:26,187 --> 00:08:29,172
No matter what I did, it wouldn’t disappear, even now, so

51
00:08:29,691 --> 00:08:32,764
Hey, I still remember

52
00:08:33,507 --> 00:08:34,523
I’m mistaken

53
00:08:34,875 --> 00:08:36,724
I don’t understand, I don’t care

54
00:08:37,475 --> 00:08:41,188
About all you humans or the truth or love or the world or pain or life

55
00:08:41,524 --> 00:08:44,668
Wanting to know what’s right or wrong is just a self-preservation instinct

56
00:08:45,228 --> 00:08:47,468
It’s your fault that I thought that

57
00:09:03,796 --> 00:09:07,219
I’ve thought about it, but I still don’t understand why I truly don’t want to get older

58
00:09:07,741 --> 00:09:11,204
Just thinking “Someday I’m going to die” makes my chest feel hollow

59
00:09:11,691 --> 00:09:13,155
“What will I do in the future?”

60
00:09:13,619 --> 00:09:18,699
When I grew up I understood That I’m not going to do anything at all

61
00:09:19,244 --> 00:09:28,467
How do I explain why I hate people who put on happy faces?

62
00:09:28,996 --> 00:09:35,868
It’s an inferiority complex haunting my unsatisfied mind like a ghost

63
00:09:36,411 --> 00:09:37,332
I’m not mistaken

64
00:09:37,683 --> 00:09:39,619
Hey, with all your differences, you all are human

65
00:09:40,324 --> 00:09:44,068
When you don’t have love or salvation or kindness or a foundation, it feels bad

66
00:09:44,611 --> 00:09:47,467
Feeling pain at something like a love song is a self-preservation instinct

67
00:09:48,451 --> 00:09:50,683
Do I really not care? It’s your fault

68
00:10:06,931 --> 00:10:08,339
I’ve thought about it, but I still don’t understand

69
00:10:08,851 --> 00:10:10,348
Why just living is painful

70
00:10:10,844 --> 00:10:12,404
Why you can’t make a living from something like music

71
00:10:12,884 --> 00:10:14,371
I don’t care if the lyrics or whatever are lazily done

72
00:10:18,132 --> 00:10:19,235
I don’t care about anything

73
00:10:21,924 --> 00:10:23,412
I’m probably not mistaken

74
00:10:26,076 --> 00:10:27,435
I’m sure I’m not mistaken

75
00:10:30,476 --> 00:10:31,579
I’m sure I’m not mistaken

76
00:10:43,419 --> 00:10:44,812
I’m mistaken, I understand

77
00:10:45,219 --> 00:10:46,899
I don’t care

78
00:10:47,516 --> 00:10:51,316
About all you humans or the truth or love or salvation or kindness or life

79
00:10:51,651 --> 00:10:54,684
Not being able to give the right answer is a self-preservation instinct

80
00:10:55,467 --> 00:10:57,588
I don’t care, it’s your fault

81
00:11:16,235 --> 00:11:17,716
Even I had faith in something once

82
00:11:18,356 --> 00:11:19,515
Now the feeling is nothing but garbage

83
00:11:20,187 --> 00:11:21,220
I wrote to you so many times

84
00:11:21,764 --> 00:11:23,931
I didn’t care about whether I’d be rich and famous

85
00:11:25,484 --> 00:11:25,868
It’s true,

86
00:11:25,948 --> 00:11:26,988
it’s really true,

87
00:11:28,683 --> 00:11:30,419
that’s how it was back then

88
00:11:30,987 --> 00:11:33,447
That’s why I

89
00:11:35,291 --> 00:11:38,380
That’s why I gave up on music

90
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:13,635
Words whitened to grey and have a color like cappuccino

91
00:12:16,179 --> 00:12:20,139
Don't bother with excuses, leave them by the window

92
00:12:24,403 --> 00:12:25,539
I can't count them all

93
00:12:44,171 --> 00:12:51,660
Heart whitened to grey has a color like cappuccino

94
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:58,595
Don't bother with excuses, let's gulp down the cappuccino

95
00:12:59,715 --> 00:13:01,171
And pretend to be foolish

96
00:13:02,899 --> 00:13:07,116
As if reluctant, the rain flows

97
00:13:07,435 --> 00:13:11,915
As we drown in the flowers storming us

98
00:13:12,243 --> 00:13:16,828
These memories I keep so that you won't fade away

99
00:13:17,268 --> 00:13:25,676
Please, please, please so you won't overflow

100
00:13:44,811 --> 00:13:49,187
A shore waiting for waves in a crimson sunset

101
00:13:50,379 --> 00:13:51,452
Reflecting on the windows

102
00:13:54,795 --> 00:13:57,027
An august in Visby,

103
00:13:57,548 --> 00:14:01,891
I waited in vain for the sea to roar with the breeze remaining

104
00:14:03,539 --> 00:14:08,851
The whiteness of the flower that swam in summer, the night rain

105
00:14:09,491 --> 00:14:12,292
Drowning in the flowing night

106
00:14:12,844 --> 00:14:17,132
A flower that nobody can let fade

107
00:14:17,756 --> 00:14:26,315
Please, please, please place it inside my chest

108
00:14:45,147 --> 00:14:46,555
Something's been wrong for a long time

109
00:14:46,987 --> 00:14:49,411
I just wanted to be told a way to live

110
00:14:49,892 --> 00:14:53,163
I no longer have anything I can pay you back with

111
00:14:54,899 --> 00:14:59,052
If you can't answer, just one word will do

112
00:14:59,444 --> 00:15:00,779
I don't understand

113
00:15:01,219 --> 00:15:02,835
I really don't understand

115
00:15:13,699 --> 00:15:18,060
As we drown in the flowers storming us

116
00:15:19,172 --> 00:15:22,643
The poem I'm writing so you won't fade

117
00:15:23,476 --> 00:15:31,827
Please, please, please so I won't forget

118
00:15:32,475 --> 00:15:36,540
Yet another summer comes to an end,

119
00:15:37,123 --> 00:15:39,619
Keeping this one flower close to my chest with tears escaping from behind my eyelids

120
00:15:40,259 --> 00:15:44,572
This poem, made so you won't fade away

121
00:15:47,819 --> 00:15:53,683
Please, please so you won't overflow

122
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:41,260
If there’s a heart inside my body, 

123
00:16:42,900 --> 00:16:45,613
right below my throat,

124
00:16:47,404 --> 00:16:57,436
Then that must be where you are

125
00:17:15,108 --> 00:17:22,580
I’ve known for a long time

126
00:17:24,092 --> 00:17:32,564
That as I got older I would even forget your face

127
00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:36,348
Because I want to know 

128
00:17:37,956 --> 00:17:40,868
the moment that words are able to form

129
00:17:42,573 --> 00:17:47,524
inside my body, 

130
00:17:48,972 --> 00:17:51,324
in my throat

131
00:17:51,996 --> 00:17:57,844
If the dawn comes like this…

132
00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:04,084
I hope that my memories don’t dry out

133
00:18:04,476 --> 00:18:08,348
I hope that I don’t lose this song

134
00:18:09,156 --> 00:18:11,268
Don’t forget, 

135
00:18:11,988 --> 00:18:15,444
for just a little longer,

136
00:18:18,524 --> 00:18:23,420
The lonely parade

137
00:18:40,724 --> 00:18:48,308
I’ve thought for a long time that

138
00:18:49,876 --> 00:18:59,371
Gods might reside in your fingertips

139
00:18:59,780 --> 00:19:01,852
Since before today, 

140
00:19:03,756 --> 00:19:06,956
before yesterday, 

141
00:19:08,372 --> 00:19:14,076
since a long, long time past

142
00:19:17,484 --> 00:19:21,284
I’ve known that

143
00:19:54,716 --> 00:19:57,772
Inside my body, 

144
00:19:59,252 --> 00:20:02,332
right below my throat

145
00:20:03,844 --> 00:20:12,412
Are the days when I’ve only been imitating your song

146
00:20:14,244 --> 00:20:16,836
I hope that I don’t forget

147
00:20:23,404 --> 00:20:28,060
The temperature of this moment in which you’re not here

148
00:20:32,813 --> 00:20:37,036
With memories that I hope won’t dry out

149
00:20:37,348 --> 00:20:41,636
With this song that I haven’t been able to forget

150
00:20:42,164 --> 00:20:44,468
Just a little bit more, 

151
00:20:45,060 --> 00:20:48,844
for just a little longer

152
00:20:53,900 --> 00:20:59,004
I’ll make a lonely parade

153
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:10,663
Say it

154
00:23:31,296 --> 00:23:31,655
You see, 

155
00:23:33,447 --> 00:23:36,855
I actually realized already

156
00:23:37,871 --> 00:23:39,655
Look, about that thing you said

157
00:23:41,767 --> 00:23:42,599
I didn't feel like

158
00:23:43,983 --> 00:23:47,575
Thinking about it too much

159
00:23:48,375 --> 00:23:50,239
So I had forgotten about it, but

160
00:23:52,032 --> 00:23:56,248
Living blindly, recklessly, delusionly

161
00:23:56,887 --> 00:24:02,983
Impulsively, impatiently, negatively didn’t do me any good​

162
00:24:07,479 --> 00:24:07,927
I’m sure​

163
00:24:08,711 --> 00:24:12,351
That on the last day of my life, when I think of what’s gone before​

164
00:24:12,879 --> 00:24:16,407
All of it, all of it will be unspeakably precious, but​

165
00:24:17,311 --> 00:24:17,663
Ah,

166
00:24:18,271 --> 00:24:23,055
On that last day of my life, you won’t be there

167
00:24:23,464 --> 00:24:26,671
More, more, more​

168
00:24:27,335 --> 00:24:31,847
Say that more clearly​

169
00:24:52,711 --> 00:24:53,271
You see,

170
00:24:55,183 --> 00:24:58,463
I’m not sure how to tell you

171
00:24:59,272 --> 00:25:01,031
That the sky is blue

172
00:25:03,191 --> 00:25:03,823
Or what

173
00:25:05,639 --> 00:25:09,159
I’d have to do to make you understand

174
00:25:09,631 --> 00:25:11,775
That the clouds at night are high

175
00:25:13,223 --> 00:25:13,975
Say it

176
00:25:34,679 --> 00:25:35,775
You see, 

177
00:25:37,127 --> 00:25:40,560
I actually know

178
00:25:41,072 --> 00:25:43,152
That you’re already gone

179
00:25:45,119 --> 00:25:45,775
You see

180
00:25:47,831 --> 00:25:50,967
You'll probably just call me obstinate

181
00:25:51,919 --> 00:25:53,751
And I want to forget, but

182
00:25:56,023 --> 00:25:57,959
Say it more clearly

183
00:25:58,367 --> 00:26:00,463
Make a note so you won't forget it

184
00:26:00,863 --> 00:26:04,551
Let's meet tomorrow at ten on the train platform, or something like that

185
00:26:06,647 --> 00:26:08,359
Even if its petals scatter, a peony is still a flower

186
00:26:08,807 --> 00:26:10,854
Even if summer ends, the memories of it are still cherished

187
00:26:11,535 --> 00:26:14,839
Put it into words, give voice to it

188
00:26:16,607 --> 00:26:17,791
Say it

189
00:26:21,191 --> 00:26:26,199
And then if I could see you on the last day of my life

190
00:26:26,679 --> 00:26:27,263
I'm sure,

191
00:26:27,679 --> 00:26:31,271
Even on the last day of my life, that I'd sing of love

192
00:26:31,679 --> 00:26:35,615
Because you'd tell me none of it, none of it was in vain

193
00:26:36,136 --> 00:26:36,375
Ah,

194
00:26:37,055 --> 00:26:41,824
I still can't believe that on the last day of my life,

195
00:26:42,135 --> 00:26:44,014
You won't be here

196
00:26:44,751 --> 00:26:49,039
More, more, more, more

197
00:26:49,871 --> 00:26:54,303
More, more, more, you have to

198
00:26:54,927 --> 00:26:58,016
More, more, more, more

199
00:26:58,719 --> 00:26:59,415
Please,

200
00:27:00,215 --> 00:27:01,159
Say it,

201
00:27:01,703 --> 00:27:03,151
More clearly
