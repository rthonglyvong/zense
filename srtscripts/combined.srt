1
00:02:37,666 --> 00:02:39,810
The scenery doesn’t change; 

2
00:02:40,089 --> 00:02:43,530
on a faded afternoon I’m lying in the deep indigo 

3
00:02:43,698 --> 00:02:47,354
beneath the overpass

4
00:02:49,386 --> 00:02:51,410
I hear a single clap 

5
00:02:51,586 --> 00:02:54,449
for my blank-page life

6
00:02:54,946 --> 00:03:01,553
I was singing about my own emptiness today, as usual

7
00:03:21,121 --> 00:03:22,945
So things wouldn’t change,

8
00:03:23,113 --> 00:03:25,825
I wrote a story starring you 

9
00:03:26,090 --> 00:03:29,561
in my notebook

10
00:03:31,377 --> 00:03:33,073
My gas and water being cut off, 

11
00:03:33,466 --> 00:03:36,225
society, and the news are all someone else’s problem

12
00:03:36,529 --> 00:03:38,642
Look, 

13
00:03:38,897 --> 00:03:40,346
my life is like ink

14
00:03:40,825 --> 00:03:51,465
The dream I had when I was young gets closer to its expiration date 

15
00:03:52,426 --> 00:03:53,825
as I get older

16
00:03:54,345 --> 00:03:58,873
Though I just, I just look up at the clouds

17
00:03:59,177 --> 00:04:04,049
As usual, they flow through my field of vision

18
00:04:04,401 --> 00:04:09,233
In the distant night sky I looked up at, flowers swam

19
00:04:09,433 --> 00:04:13,185
So many that it could be mistaken for spring

20
00:04:13,498 --> 00:04:18,401
As if I’d just lost sight of you

21
00:04:38,057 --> 00:04:40,665
I looked down so I wouldn’t trip

22
00:04:40,905 --> 00:04:42,737
Life is made of 

23
00:04:42,913 --> 00:04:46,337
nothing but compromises

24
00:04:48,025 --> 00:04:52,665
I don’t believe in hearts or fate or love songs or life

25
00:04:53,113 --> 00:04:56,073
After all, if you can’t sell something it has no value

26
00:04:57,017 --> 00:05:01,497
I intentionally discarded the present I dreamed of, 

27
00:05:01,906 --> 00:05:07,753
and now I’m lying here waiting for 

28
00:05:08,069 --> 00:05:10,017
its expiration date

29
00:05:10,450 --> 00:05:15,201
Behind my eyelids, I just, I just saw

30
00:05:15,457 --> 00:05:20,330
An imagined, distant vision of you

31
00:05:20,649 --> 00:05:25,209
In my notebook, flowers swim in the corner of a faded night

32
00:05:25,505 --> 00:05:29,657
One more is in my eye

33
00:05:30,477 --> 00:05:33,601
Life is just one compromise after another

34
00:05:33,761 --> 00:05:35,601
I learned that pretty fast

35
00:05:35,809 --> 00:05:38,265
Elma, it’s you

36
00:05:38,657 --> 00:05:41,009
You alone are my music

37
00:05:41,553 --> 00:05:43,737
There are only eighty more characters in this song

38
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:45,457
Because maybe the only value of a life 

39
00:05:47,829 --> 00:05:51,994
is in the way it ends

40
00:05:55,793 --> 00:06:00,369
I just, I just picture you

41
00:06:00,577 --> 00:06:05,258
As even the indigo filling my vision is blurred

42
00:06:05,658 --> 00:06:10,473
In the distant sky I looked up at, flowers swam

43
00:06:10,746 --> 00:06:15,089
Deep indigo covers my eyes

44
00:06:15,473 --> 00:06:19,281
It’s just, it’s just…

45
00:06:25,622 --> 00:06:31,921
In the distant sky I looked up at, you are cooling off

46
00:06:35,426 --> 00:06:39,233
As if you were just swimming in the night

47
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:33,267
I’ve thought about it, but I still don’t understand

48
00:07:33,955 --> 00:07:35,467
Under the blue sky, I waited for you

49
00:07:36,052 --> 00:07:38,692
On that breezy afternoon, my imagination escaped the confines of the day

50
00:07:39,036 --> 00:07:41,076
Hey, where do I go from here?

51
00:07:41,636 --> 00:07:43,091
No one has told me how to proceed

52
00:07:43,715 --> 00:07:46,724
I looked into your eyes and without a word I walked away

53
00:08:03,316 --> 00:08:04,755
I’ve thought about it, but I still don’t understand

54
00:08:05,219 --> 00:08:06,660
Youth is so boring

55
00:08:07,148 --> 00:08:10,419
I tried to give up piano, but I can’t break the habit of playing on my desk*

56
00:08:10,748 --> 00:08:12,500
Hey, what will I do in the future?

57
00:08:12,851 --> 00:08:14,411
It shouldn’t be music, right?

58
00:08:16,596 --> 00:08:17,355
Don’t worry

59
00:08:17,987 --> 00:08:25,779
Even if I plucked a single string in my heart

60
00:08:26,187 --> 00:08:29,172
No matter what I did, it wouldn’t disappear, even now, so

61
00:08:29,691 --> 00:08:32,764
Hey, I still remember

62
00:08:33,507 --> 00:08:34,523
I’m mistaken

63
00:08:34,875 --> 00:08:36,724
I don’t understand, I don’t care

64
00:08:37,475 --> 00:08:41,188
About all you humans or the truth or love or the world or pain or life

65
00:08:41,524 --> 00:08:44,668
Wanting to know what’s right or wrong is just a self-preservation instinct

66
00:08:45,228 --> 00:08:47,468
It’s your fault that I thought that

67
00:09:03,796 --> 00:09:07,219
I’ve thought about it, but I still don’t understand why I truly don’t want to get older

68
00:09:07,741 --> 00:09:11,204
Just thinking “Someday I’m going to die” makes my chest feel hollow

69
00:09:11,691 --> 00:09:13,155
“What will I do in the future?”

70
00:09:13,619 --> 00:09:18,699
When I grew up I understood That I’m not going to do anything at all

71
00:09:19,244 --> 00:09:28,467
How do I explain why I hate people who put on happy faces?

72
00:09:28,996 --> 00:09:35,868
It’s an inferiority complex haunting my unsatisfied mind like a ghost

73
00:09:36,411 --> 00:09:37,332
I’m not mistaken

74
00:09:37,683 --> 00:09:39,619
Hey, with all your differences, you all are human

75
00:09:40,324 --> 00:09:44,068
When you don’t have love or salvation or kindness or a foundation, it feels bad

76
00:09:44,611 --> 00:09:47,467
Feeling pain at something like a love song is a self-preservation instinct

77
00:09:48,451 --> 00:09:50,683
Do I really not care? It’s your fault

78
00:10:06,931 --> 00:10:08,339
I’ve thought about it, but I still don’t understand

79
00:10:08,851 --> 00:10:10,348
Why just living is painful

80
00:10:10,844 --> 00:10:12,404
Why you can’t make a living from something like music

81
00:10:12,884 --> 00:10:14,371
I don’t care if the lyrics or whatever are lazily done

82
00:10:18,132 --> 00:10:19,235
I don’t care about anything

83
00:10:21,924 --> 00:10:23,412
I’m probably not mistaken

84
00:10:26,076 --> 00:10:27,435
I’m sure I’m not mistaken

85
00:10:30,476 --> 00:10:31,579
I’m sure I’m not mistaken

86
00:10:43,419 --> 00:10:44,812
I’m mistaken, I understand

87
00:10:45,219 --> 00:10:46,899
I don’t care

88
00:10:47,516 --> 00:10:51,316
About all you humans or the truth or love or salvation or kindness or life

89
00:10:51,651 --> 00:10:54,684
Not being able to give the right answer is a self-preservation instinct

90
00:10:55,467 --> 00:10:57,588
I don’t care, it’s your fault

91
00:11:16,235 --> 00:11:17,716
Even I had faith in something once

92
00:11:18,356 --> 00:11:19,515
Now the feeling is nothing but garbage

93
00:11:20,187 --> 00:11:21,220
I wrote to you so many times

94
00:11:21,764 --> 00:11:23,931
I didn’t care about whether I’d be rich and famous

95
00:11:25,484 --> 00:11:25,868
It’s true,

96
00:11:25,948 --> 00:11:26,988
it’s really true,

97
00:11:28,683 --> 00:11:30,419
that’s how it was back then

98
00:11:30,987 --> 00:11:33,447
That’s why I

99
00:11:35,291 --> 00:11:38,380
That’s why I gave up on music

100
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:12,824
Words whitened to grey and have a color like cappuccino

101
00:12:15,559 --> 00:12:19,615
Don't bother with excuses, leave them by the window

102
00:12:23,871 --> 00:12:25,048
I can't count them all

103
00:12:43,848 --> 00:12:51,239
Heart whitened to grey has a color like cappuccino

104
00:12:53,887 --> 00:12:58,360
Don't bother with excuses, let's gulp down the cappuccino

105
00:12:59,248 --> 00:13:00,687
And pretend to be foolish

106
00:13:02,416 --> 00:13:06,334
As if reluctant, the rain flows

107
00:13:06,839 --> 00:13:11,287
As we drown in the flowers storming us

108
00:13:11,727 --> 00:13:16,504
These memories I keep so that you won't fade away

109
00:13:16,792 --> 00:13:25,455
Please, please, please so you won't overflow

110
00:13:44,455 --> 00:13:48,688
A shore waiting for waves in a crimson sunset

111
00:13:49,888 --> 00:13:51,312
Reflecting on the windows

112
00:13:54,272 --> 00:13:56,608
An august in Visby,

113
00:13:56,967 --> 00:14:01,408
I waited in vain for the sea to roar with the breeze remaining

114
00:14:02,903 --> 00:14:08,344
The whiteness of the flower that swam in summer, the night rain

115
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:11,824
Drowning in the flowing night

116
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:16,679
A flower that nobody can let fade

117
00:14:17,119 --> 00:14:25,712
Please, please, please place it inside my chest

118
00:14:44,655 --> 00:14:46,016
Something's been wrong for a long time

119
00:14:46,424 --> 00:14:48,807
I just wanted to be told a way to live

120
00:14:49,359 --> 00:14:52,592
I no longer have anything I can pay you back with

121
00:14:54,399 --> 00:14:58,600
If you can't answer, just one word will do

122
00:14:59,048 --> 00:14:59,744
I don't understand

123
00:15:00,296 --> 00:15:02,640
I really don't understand

124
00:15:08,416 --> 00:15:12,552
As if reluctant, the rain flows

125
00:15:12,968 --> 00:15:17,440
As we drown in the flowers storming us

126
00:15:17,903 --> 00:15:22,503
The poem I'm writing so you won't fade

127
00:15:23,055 --> 00:15:31,536
Please, please, please so I won't forget

128
00:15:32,031 --> 00:15:36,520
Yet another summer comes to an end,

129
00:15:36,727 --> 00:15:38,496
Keeping this one flower close to my chest with tears escaping from behind my eyelids

130
00:15:39,751 --> 00:15:45,927
This poem, made so you won't fade away

131
00:15:47,328 --> 00:15:53,239
Please, please so you won't overflow

132
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:41,260
If there’s a heart inside my body, 

133
00:16:42,900 --> 00:16:45,613
right below my throat,

134
00:16:47,404 --> 00:16:57,436
Then that must be where you are

135
00:17:15,108 --> 00:17:22,580
I’ve known for a long time

136
00:17:24,092 --> 00:17:32,564
That as I got older I would even forget your face

137
00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:36,348
Because I want to know 

138
00:17:37,956 --> 00:17:40,868
the moment that words are able to form

139
00:17:42,573 --> 00:17:47,524
inside my body, 

140
00:17:48,972 --> 00:17:51,324
in my throat

141
00:17:51,996 --> 00:17:57,844
If the dawn comes like this…

142
00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:04,084
I hope that my memories don’t dry out

143
00:18:04,476 --> 00:18:08,348
I hope that I don’t lose this song

144
00:18:09,156 --> 00:18:11,268
Don’t forget, 

145
00:18:11,988 --> 00:18:15,444
for just a little longer,

146
00:18:18,524 --> 00:18:23,420
The lonely parade

147
00:18:40,724 --> 00:18:48,308
I’ve thought for a long time that

148
00:18:49,876 --> 00:18:59,371
Gods might reside in your fingertips

149
00:18:59,780 --> 00:19:01,852
Since before today, 

150
00:19:03,756 --> 00:19:06,956
before yesterday, 

151
00:19:08,372 --> 00:19:14,076
since a long, long time past

152
00:19:17,484 --> 00:19:21,284
I’ve known that

153
00:19:54,716 --> 00:19:57,772
Inside my body, 

154
00:19:59,252 --> 00:20:02,332
right below my throat

155
00:20:03,844 --> 00:20:12,412
Are the days when I’ve only been imitating your song

156
00:20:14,244 --> 00:20:16,836
I hope that I don’t forget

157
00:20:23,404 --> 00:20:28,060
The temperature of this moment in which you’re not here

158
00:20:32,813 --> 00:20:37,036
With memories that I hope won’t dry out

159
00:20:37,348 --> 00:20:41,636
With this song that I haven’t been able to forget

160
00:20:42,164 --> 00:20:44,468
Just a little bit more, 

161
00:20:45,060 --> 00:20:48,844
for just a little longer

162
00:20:53,900 --> 00:20:59,004
I’ll make a lonely parade

163
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:10,663
Say it

164
00:23:31,296 --> 00:23:31,655
You see, 

165
00:23:33,447 --> 00:23:36,855
I actually realized already

166
00:23:37,871 --> 00:23:39,655
Look, about that thing you said

167
00:23:41,767 --> 00:23:42,599
I didn't feel like

168
00:23:43,983 --> 00:23:47,575
Thinking about it too much

169
00:23:48,375 --> 00:23:50,239
So I had forgotten about it, but

170
00:23:52,032 --> 00:23:56,248
Living blindly, recklessly, delusionly

171
00:23:56,887 --> 00:24:02,983
Impulsively, impatiently, negatively didn’t do me any good​

172
00:24:07,479 --> 00:24:07,927
I’m sure​

173
00:24:08,711 --> 00:24:12,351
That on the last day of my life, when I think of what’s gone before​

174
00:24:12,879 --> 00:24:16,407
All of it, all of it will be unspeakably precious, but​

175
00:24:17,311 --> 00:24:17,663
Ah,

176
00:24:18,271 --> 00:24:23,055
On that last day of my life, you won’t be there

177
00:24:23,464 --> 00:24:26,671
More, more, more​

178
00:24:28,335 --> 00:24:31,847
Say that more clearly​

179
00:24:52,711 --> 00:24:53,271
You see,

180
00:24:55,183 --> 00:24:58,463
I’m not sure how to tell you

181
00:24:59,272 --> 00:25:01,031
That the sky is blue

182
00:25:03,191 --> 00:25:03,823
Or what

183
00:25:05,639 --> 00:25:09,159
I’d have to do to make you understand

184
00:25:09,631 --> 00:25:11,775
That the clouds at night are high

185
00:25:13,223 --> 00:25:13,975
Say it

186
00:25:34,679 --> 00:25:35,775
You see, 

187
00:25:37,127 --> 00:25:40,560
I actually know

188
00:25:41,072 --> 00:25:43,152
That you’re already gone

189
00:25:45,119 --> 00:25:45,775
You see

190
00:25:47,831 --> 00:25:50,967
You'll probably just call me obstinate

191
00:25:51,919 --> 00:25:53,751
And I want to forget, but

192
00:25:56,023 --> 00:25:57,959
Say it more clearly

193
00:25:58,367 --> 00:26:00,463
Make a note so you won't forget it

194
00:26:00,863 --> 00:26:04,551
Let's meet tomorrow at ten on the train platform, or something like that

195
00:26:06,647 --> 00:26:08,359
Even if its petals scatter, a peony is still a flower

196
00:26:08,807 --> 00:26:10,854
Even if summer ends, the memories of it are still cherished

197
00:26:11,535 --> 00:26:14,839
Put it into words, give voice to it

198
00:26:16,607 --> 00:26:17,791
Say it

199
00:26:21,191 --> 00:26:26,199
And then if I could see you on the last day of my life

200
00:26:26,679 --> 00:26:27,263
I'm sure,

201
00:26:27,679 --> 00:26:31,271
Even on the last day of my life, that I'd sing of love

202
00:26:31,679 --> 00:26:35,615
Because you'd tell me none of it, none of it was in vain

203
00:26:36,136 --> 00:26:36,375
Ah,

204
00:26:37,055 --> 00:26:41,824
I still can't believe that on the last day of my life,

205
00:26:42,135 --> 00:26:44,014
You won't be here

206
00:26:44,751 --> 00:26:49,039
More, more, more, more

207
00:26:49,871 --> 00:26:54,303
More, more, more, you have to

208
00:26:54,927 --> 00:26:58,016
More, more, more, more

209
00:26:58,719 --> 00:26:59,415
Please,

210
00:27:00,215 --> 00:27:01,159
Say it,

211
00:27:01,703 --> 00:27:03,151
More clearly

212
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,744
The moon that floated in the night like a jelly fish

213
00:27:45,064 --> 00:27:49,072
Has split open

214
00:27:49,432 --> 00:27:53,527
When I glance at someone’s back at the bus stop

215
00:27:54,271 --> 00:27:58,640
You, as you were that summer, are in my head

216
00:28:06,784 --> 00:28:06,967
Only

217
00:28:14,752 --> 00:28:17,328
Torii gates, dried-out clouds;

218
00:28:18,768 --> 00:28:22,776
the scent of summer strokes my cheek

219
00:28:23,271 --> 00:28:25,751
Until I become an adult,

220
00:28:26,479 --> 00:28:27,104
look,

221
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:29,640
I’ll keep standing on tiptoe to make myself taller

222
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:34,416
Tired out from playing,

223
00:28:35,584 --> 00:28:39,576
behind the bus stop I could even see the sky

224
00:28:39,888 --> 00:28:43,840
Even if the summer comes to an end soon

225
00:28:44,128 --> 00:28:47,969
I’ll definitely, definitely remember

226
00:28:48,767 --> 00:28:52,872
Becoming an adult without being able to catch up

227
00:28:53,167 --> 00:28:56,591
Night blooms in your pocket

228
00:28:56,944 --> 00:29:01,632
If I can’t put it into words I’ll be alone

229
00:29:01,863 --> 00:29:04,472
But that’s all right,

230
00:29:04,664 --> 00:29:06,719
I’ve already resigned myself to it

231
00:29:09,705 --> 00:29:10,447
Only

232
00:29:26,689 --> 00:29:29,256
A summer day, dried-out clouds,

233
00:29:30,687 --> 00:29:34,616
Nanking cherry trees, a rusted stoplight

234
00:29:34,936 --> 00:29:41,959
In my memories, it always smells like summer

235
00:29:43,344 --> 00:29:46,408
Photographs are just scraps of paper

236
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:51,624
And memories are nothing but garbage

237
00:29:51,928 --> 00:29:59,080
Because I didn’t understand that, I kept my mouth shut

238
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:09,032
In my memory, you rest forever on the single stone in a summer field*

239
00:30:09,543 --> 00:30:13,719
Becoming an adult while looking down

240
00:30:13,991 --> 00:30:17,759
I can’t catch up, it’s just a sunny day for you

241
00:30:18,064 --> 00:30:22,032
Unable to put things into words, we climbed the hill

242
00:30:22,513 --> 00:30:24,760
In our shadows,

243
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,359
night is blooming

244
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:49,352
We’ve become adults

245
00:30:50,927 --> 00:30:51,840
while looking down

246
00:30:52,399 --> 00:30:55,312
Clap your hands how you like

247
00:30:56,216 --> 00:31:00,319
Climbing the road up the hill at sunset

248
00:31:00,616 --> 00:31:02,896
Our shadows…

249
00:31:04,159 --> 00:31:08,967
Becoming an adult without being able to catch up

250
00:31:09,255 --> 00:31:13,200
Night blooms in your pocket

251
00:31:13,544 --> 00:31:17,592
Even if we can’t put it into words, we are one**

252
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:21,023
That’s enough, I think

253
00:31:22,016 --> 00:31:27,136
I’m only chewing over memories

254
00:31:34,136 --> 00:31:34,967
of you

255
00:32:19,500 --> 00:32:24,212
“Why does the scent of the rain make me feel nostalgic?

256
00:32:25,179 --> 00:32:29,931
Why does my heart clamor as summer approaches?

257
00:32:30,868 --> 00:32:35,716
Why do I cry when people laugh at me?

258
00:32:36,691 --> 00:32:41,340
Is it all right to think that even so I’ll be rewarded someday?”

259
00:32:42,092 --> 00:32:44,708
With the word “goodbye”

260
00:32:44,988 --> 00:32:47,372
tearing so much at my chest,

261
00:32:47,732 --> 00:32:52,731
I was standing still for just a few moments

262
00:32:53,244 --> 00:32:55,420
at sunset

263
00:32:56,243 --> 00:32:58,147
“Teacher, I want to talk about my life.

264
00:32:58,699 --> 00:33:01,227
What should I do from now on?

265
00:33:01,540 --> 00:33:05,964
Are you just going to tell me ‘no one knows that’ or something?

266
00:33:06,180 --> 00:33:07,012
Look,

267
00:33:07,444 --> 00:33:09,627
it’s not that I want to suffer.

268
00:33:10,036 --> 00:33:13,364
I just want to live without doing anything.

269
00:33:13,595 --> 00:33:16,397
Is it selfish to just want to look at the blue sky?”

270
00:33:31,004 --> 00:33:35,460
“Why do I lie even though it makes my heart ache?

271
00:33:36,363 --> 00:33:41,117
Why do only bad people prosper?

272
00:33:42,108 --> 00:33:47,147
Why is it that the character for ‘happiness’(幸) includes the ‘money’(￥)sign?

273
00:33:47,516 --> 00:33:52,980
Is it on purpose that leaving out a single stroke turns it into the character for ‘pain’(辛)?”

274
00:33:53,363 --> 00:33:55,964
With a price sticker saying “youth”

275
00:33:56,275 --> 00:33:58,644
stuck to my back

276
00:33:59,059 --> 00:34:03,844
I was hoping in some way for

277
00:34:05,108 --> 00:34:06,939
Hitchcock-like suspense

278
00:34:07,355 --> 00:34:09,628
“Teacher, I don’t care.

279
00:34:10,036 --> 00:34:12,300
Just going on living causes me pain.

280
00:34:13,028 --> 00:34:17,119
Neither Nietzche nor Freud wrote about how to fill this hole.

281
00:34:17,708 --> 00:34:18,184
I just

282
00:34:19,424 --> 00:34:21,452
want to close my eyes in the scent of summer,

283
00:34:21,571 --> 00:34:23,803
And sketch out the height of the clouds with my fingers.

284
00:34:24,244 --> 00:34:27,708
Is it selfish to just want to relive memories?”

285
00:34:38,667 --> 00:34:43,756
“A story where people die dramatically will sell, won’t it?

286
00:34:44,380 --> 00:34:49,060
I’ve come to hate that even the moment that a flower’s petals fall has a price on it.

287
00:34:50,108 --> 00:34:53,459
What was your dream, Teacher?

288
00:34:55,667 --> 00:34:59,828
Did you forget it when you became an adult?”

289
00:35:01,315 --> 00:35:03,460
"Teacher, I want to talk about my life.

290
00:35:04,132 --> 00:35:06,548
What should I do from now on?

291
00:35:07,148 --> 00:35:11,580
‘Tears make people stronger’ was nothing but sophism

292
00:35:11,971 --> 00:35:12,419
Yes,

293
00:35:12,884 --> 00:35:15,539
it’s not that I don’t care what happens to me,

294
00:35:15,860 --> 00:35:17,928
it’s just that reality is flickering,

295
00:35:18,476 --> 00:35:19,844
And summer is far away.

296
00:35:21,371 --> 00:35:23,532
Is this really all right?

297
00:35:24,204 --> 00:35:26,684
Can I go on living like this?

298
00:35:27,084 --> 00:35:31,612
Are you just going to tell me ‘only you can answer that’ or something?

299
00:35:31,852 --> 00:35:32,523
I just

300
00:35:32,836 --> 00:35:35,299
Want to close my eyes to the scent of summer.

301
00:35:35,756 --> 00:35:37,924
I want to feel the wind always.

302
00:35:38,451 --> 00:35:42,027
Is it selfish to just want to look at the blue sky?”

303
00:35:44,387 --> 00:35:47,892
Is it selfish if I just want to know you?

304
00:37:45,699 --> 00:37:47,860
It's alright, it's alright

305
00:37:48,331 --> 00:37:49,836
If you sleep it over, everything will straighten out one way or another

306
00:37:50,236 --> 00:37:52,947
What's the matter, why make that face?

307
00:37:53,292 --> 00:37:54,595
It doesn't really make a difference either way

308
00:37:56,036 --> 00:37:58,187
In vain I'm waiting for love in front of a train station

309
00:37:58,580 --> 00:38:00,499
I have nothing else to do after all

310
00:38:00,835 --> 00:38:03,811
Please explain to me the worth of dishonesty

311
00:38:05,675 --> 00:38:10,819
Don't say a word, forget about such things as love

312
00:38:11,316 --> 00:38:14,771
Tell me about everything, even what brings you pain

313
00:38:15,243 --> 00:38:21,267
If just one such dragonfly is enough, I would rather forget

314
00:38:21,491 --> 00:38:24,587
I can't listen to you spewing nothing but empty words

315
00:38:26,124 --> 00:38:26,988
Yet I don't want to say it

316
00:38:48,347 --> 00:38:50,795
It's alright, no matter how much you try to express yourself

317
00:38:51,347 --> 00:38:52,723
Words are never enough for you

318
00:38:53,115 --> 00:38:55,715
What's the matter, don't you get it?

319
00:38:55,988 --> 00:38:56,875
- This anguish

320
00:38:58,755 --> 00:39:01,060
In vain I'm waiting for love at your front door

321
00:39:01,443 --> 00:39:03,020
Trying to suppress my voice, I struggle for air

322
00:39:03,779 --> 00:39:06,947
Please teach me the meaning of regret

323
00:39:08,635 --> 00:39:13,380
If you can, please forget things like that heat haze and the events of today

324
00:39:13,772 --> 00:39:17,716
And please sing nothing but songs of simple sorrowful love

325
00:39:18,035 --> 00:39:23,972
I would rather you not say "For the finale, a single kiss is enough"

326
00:39:24,268 --> 00:39:27,579
I can't forget even your empty words

327
00:39:28,859 --> 00:39:29,859
I don't want to know the truth

328
00:39:53,428 --> 00:39:59,460
Someday you'll forget such things as that heat haze and the events of today, right? It hurts

329
00:40:02,843 --> 00:40:08,579
If that one hesitation is love, then I would rather be ignorant

330
00:40:08,891 --> 00:40:12,595
Let me hear even your empty words more and more

331
00:40:14,091 --> 00:40:18,979
Don't say a word, forget about such things as tomorrow

332
00:40:19,324 --> 00:40:23,155
No matter how many times, please tell me about even what brings you pain

333
00:40:23,540 --> 00:40:29,515
A single unsightly dragonfly is plenty, I want it so bad - I could be absorbed by it

334
00:40:29,795 --> 00:40:33,107
Let me hear even your empty words more and more

335
00:40:34,492 --> 00:40:36,420
I just want your love

336
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:49,129
You, who are so kind to others, could never understand this heart of mine.

337
00:41:49,872 --> 00:41:54,040
I enjoy cursing others, that used to be why I wrote songs.

338
00:41:55,288 --> 00:41:59,320
I had dreamt of being featured in the morning news, someday;

339
00:42:00,040 --> 00:42:03,200
for that reason, I sharpen my knife.

340
00:42:04,736 --> 00:42:07,240
The sound of glass being smashed,

341
00:42:07,584 --> 00:42:09,664
the act of ripping apart some kind of paper,

342
00:42:10,097 --> 00:42:13,472
the setting sun after a farewell –

343
00:42:15,192 --> 00:42:16,656
surely, even you understand that they're beautiful, right?

344
00:42:17,144 --> 00:42:21,728
The crows' song is dyed a deep red,

345
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:26,896
and this loneliness, too, turns into sound.

346
00:42:27,232 --> 00:42:31,272
In the last traces of the dusk in my memory

347
00:42:31,528 --> 00:42:36,176
You stand on your tiptoes; the clouds burn red,

348
00:42:36,616 --> 00:42:40,768
and the word "goodbye" slips from my mouth

349
00:43:00,928 --> 00:43:03,008
I want to be acknowledged, I want to love–

350
00:43:03,264 --> 00:43:05,072
are these what they call "dreams?"

351
00:43:05,471 --> 00:43:07,384
Even if I do nothing to achieve them, let them come true.

352
00:43:07,776 --> 00:43:09,896
Hurry up and gratify me.

353
00:43:10,952 --> 00:43:15,136
Society, which is so kind to others, could never understand this envy.

354
00:43:15,351 --> 00:43:18,920
I'm always looking for an opportunity to hit someone.

355
00:43:20,968 --> 00:43:25,584
A streetlight struck by a bottle of beer, the sound of a guitar breaking after being thrown;

356
00:43:25,880 --> 00:43:29,232
all these irreparable regrets are beautiful—

357
00:43:29,632 --> 00:43:32,544
That said, even I understand! And yet...

358
00:43:32,824 --> 00:43:37,600
I'm struck by a rain of words,

359
00:43:37,816 --> 00:43:42,744
and winter tumbles down on me even as I hold autumn dearly in my arms.

360
00:43:43,024 --> 00:43:47,224
From behind the mountain in spring,

361
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:51,784
one more breath of smoke drifts upwards—

362
00:43:52,560 --> 00:43:56,536
and the summer breeze slips across my cheek.

363
00:44:06,848 --> 00:44:10,856
You, who are so kind to others, could never understand this loneliness of mine.

364
00:44:11,240 --> 00:44:13,552
I don't want to die, but I can't go on living;

365
00:44:13,928 --> 00:44:15,551
that's why I write songs.

366
00:44:16,984 --> 00:44:21,512
I think disparagement, disappointment, and disgust have all have their eyes on me.

367
00:44:22,040 --> 00:44:24,808
That's why I write songs that hurt people.

368
00:44:27,288 --> 00:44:30,048
That's why I write vapid songs such as this.

369
00:44:33,696 --> 00:44:38,616
I want to swallow your words.

370
00:44:38,960 --> 00:44:42,176
I don't even have anything to put them in,

371
00:44:42,392 --> 00:44:44,008
so I use both my hands.

372
00:44:44,320 --> 00:44:48,720
Before i know it my throat will get wet,

373
00:44:49,088 --> 00:44:53,264
And while I wait for that time to come...

374
00:44:54,288 --> 00:44:59,176
The crows' song is dyed a deep red,

375
00:44:59,488 --> 00:45:04,352
and I plead for this loneliness to transform into song.

376
00:45:04,631 --> 00:45:08,672
The word "goodbye" dyes you a deep red,

377
00:45:08,904 --> 00:45:13,504
and, now, I wait for the night.

378
00:45:13,568 --> 00:45:17,536
The words "see you tomorrow" slip off my mouth.

379
00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:29,343
Setting aside my goodbye and holding a flower,

380
00:46:30,104 --> 00:46:33,439
An uncertain sun dawned outside

381
00:46:34,088 --> 00:46:36,799
I woke up in an empty room,

382
00:46:37,687 --> 00:46:41,408
Leaving behind a piece of warmth.

383
00:46:57,887 --> 00:47:04,823
I can’t remember what happened last night, not even a little bit,

384
00:47:05,631 --> 00:47:11,880
But I just have this feeling that someone else was there.

385
00:47:13,199 --> 00:47:20,247
My head’s not spinning, but I have a hangover

386
00:47:21,143 --> 00:47:27,263
Even though I don’t understand, that’s beautiful in itself.

387
00:47:28,495 --> 00:47:35,119
A toothbrush on the counter, someone’s cup, skin lotion,

388
00:47:35,407 --> 00:47:38,687
Everything I can’t remember,

389
00:47:39,150 --> 00:47:42,791
And the scent of flowers on my pillow

390
00:47:43,119 --> 00:47:47,135
Setting aside my goodbye and holding a flower,

391
00:47:47,575 --> 00:47:51,383
An uncertain sun dawned outside

392
00:47:51,871 --> 00:47:55,119
I’m waking up in an empty room,

393
00:47:55,519 --> 00:47:59,271
Leaving behind a piece of warmth.

394
00:48:15,808 --> 00:48:22,895
I don’t remember last night that well,

395
00:48:23,647 --> 00:48:29,976
But I don’t feel like I fell for a badger game either.

396
00:48:31,479 --> 00:48:38,591
My hangover cleared and I thought about it,

397
00:48:39,423 --> 00:48:42,095
But I’m fine with not understanding –

398
00:48:42,415 --> 00:48:45,247
If anything, I prefer it that way.

399
00:48:46,863 --> 00:48:53,527
A lavender blooming by the window, a dirty sink, a knitted muffler,

400
00:48:53,791 --> 00:48:56,768
Everything I can’t remember,

401
00:48:57,479 --> 00:49:01,168
And the scent of spring in the room

402
00:49:01,455 --> 00:49:05,495
Grasping at the drifting clouds like a game,

403
00:49:06,215 --> 00:49:09,807
The day grew dark like no one was coming.

404
00:49:10,240 --> 00:49:13,583
The setting sun shone through a window,

405
00:49:13,887 --> 00:49:17,471
Leaving me behind without a clue.

406
00:49:34,215 --> 00:49:41,119
I actually remember a bit of last night,

407
00:49:41,815 --> 00:49:47,663
And about continuing a life without you in it.

408
00:49:49,399 --> 00:49:56,519
Even now, I can only think of this one thing,

409
00:49:57,360 --> 00:50:03,871
How you disappeared and left me holding a flower.

410
00:50:08,183 --> 00:50:11,159
Surely you’ll come back tomorrow,

411
00:50:11,823 --> 00:50:15,103
Coming home like nothing ever happened.

412
00:50:15,688 --> 00:50:20,310
I can hear you opening the door now,

413
00:50:20,559 --> 00:50:23,199
Saying, “sorry for being late.”

414
00:50:23,543 --> 00:50:27,063
I’ve been waiting for just those words,

415
00:50:27,431 --> 00:50:31,071
Waiting intently for the sunset…

416
00:50:39,879 --> 00:50:44,007
Before I forget it all, I’ll draw a flower

417
00:50:44,247 --> 00:50:48,423
Once again, I’m alone at night

418
00:50:48,671 --> 00:50:52,015
Falling asleep in an empty room,

419
00:50:52,183 --> 00:50:55,847
As you leave your warmth on me.

420
00:50:56,287 --> 00:50:59,407
Like a fool, I’m holding a flower

421
00:50:59,903 --> 00:51:03,631
As spring comes to this room once again

422
00:51:04,095 --> 00:51:07,231
I’m living in a town without you in it,

423
00:51:07,559 --> 00:51:11,359
As you leave your warmth on me -

424
00:51:11,671 --> 00:51:15,647
As you leave a single flower to me.

425
00:51:20,030 --> 00:51:25,271
I’ve been waiting for just those words,

426
00:51:28,191 --> 00:51:33,511
Waiting intently for the sunset…

427
00:52:35,700 --> 00:52:41,907
Emerging from the curve of the bridge, the sky’s blue slipped between the clouds

428
00:52:43,364 --> 00:52:49,267
Because of how hot it has recently been, I’ve been waiting for the wind to blow past me

429
00:52:50,883 --> 00:52:53,124
As I’m sitting in the shade of a tree

430
00:52:54,724 --> 00:52:56,707
Something lands on my cheek

431
00:52:58,412 --> 00:53:02,731
And as I look overhead, I see above me the blossoms chip off

432
00:53:05,811 --> 00:53:09,571
Akin to gently falling flowers, we forgot how to breathe ¹

433
00:53:09,852 --> 00:53:13,467
Even blinking is such a pain

434
00:53:13,747 --> 00:53:16,996
You know yourself that even today will turn to past the next day

435
00:53:17,700 --> 00:53:20,708
I’m just waiting for the wind to come

436
00:53:21,220 --> 00:53:24,891
And so as we forgot how to utter all words

437
00:53:25,107 --> 00:53:28,812
Even telling goodbye’s such a pain

438
00:53:29,067 --> 00:53:33,540
Just the image of flowers falling on a sunny day

439
00:53:33,860 --> 00:53:36,643
Makes it look like it’s spring’s take on a snow storm

440
00:53:52,747 --> 00:53:54,483
Meeting with you on the next day

441
00:53:56,355 --> 00:53:58,828
I see that not so many people are here viewing flowers

442
00:54:00,235 --> 00:54:02,332
The spring’s scent is leaving the air

443
00:54:03,900 --> 00:54:06,132
I wonder if this year as well summer will reach us

444
00:54:07,763 --> 00:54:14,292
Emerging from the curve of the bridge, your face peeked from the end of the road

445
00:54:15,635 --> 00:54:17,820
I wonder how much there is left

446
00:54:19,491 --> 00:54:21,596
How many more times will we be able to meet in this spring

447
00:54:23,155 --> 00:54:29,092
On a riverside hill, I sit in the shade of a tree

448
00:54:30,652 --> 00:54:36,555
Surrounded by blossoms, not different from yesterday

449
00:54:38,076 --> 00:54:41,756
Completely forgetting how to breathe in the air

450
00:54:42,060 --> 00:54:45,716
Even blinking for us's such a pain

451
00:54:46,020 --> 00:54:49,387
Right now this vile storm is taking all the blossoms in

452
00:54:49,875 --> 00:54:52,995
Just like a spring thief

453
00:54:53,307 --> 00:54:56,996
And all our time today has gone away with the wind

454
00:54:57,204 --> 00:55:00,908
Even standing is such a pain

455
00:55:01,108 --> 00:55:05,732
In the gaps between the blossoms, the sky's chipping off

456
00:55:05,964 --> 00:55:08,836
Spring’s snow storm still rages on

457
00:55:24,507 --> 00:55:26,779
Today again I’m going to see you

458
00:55:28,387 --> 00:55:30,564
Sitting in the shade of a tree

459
00:55:32,140 --> 00:55:34,468
A single sigh takes the stage

460
00:55:36,020 --> 00:55:38,324
The blossoms are no more

461
00:55:39,812 --> 00:55:42,180
Tomorrow again I’m about to see you

462
00:55:43,547 --> 00:55:45,947
The spring is nearing its end

463
00:55:47,380 --> 00:55:52,188
The falling time stays here in remnants of what we used to be

464
00:55:55,253 --> 00:55:58,515
When singing of love, there are never enough words

465
00:55:58,819 --> 00:56:02,387
Even rhyming them's a pain

466
00:56:02,684 --> 00:56:09,484
Can you even begin to describe the moment flowers start to bloom with such a thing?

467
00:56:09,964 --> 00:56:13,827
Akin to gently falling flowers, forgetting how to let out a voice

468
00:56:14,124 --> 00:56:17,764
Even blinking for us's such a pain

469
00:56:18,123 --> 00:56:20,628
Only we are here to watch the cherry blossoms

470
00:56:21,900 --> 00:56:25,580
Don’t chip them off just yet, spring’s snow storm

471
00:56:26,035 --> 00:56:28,500
There’s only that much left

472
00:56:29,307 --> 00:56:31,940
So little, that you can count them down

473
00:56:40,756 --> 00:56:44,332
Only two blossoms left

474
00:56:48,812 --> 00:56:51,412
Just one blossom left

475
00:56:56,476 --> 00:57:00,940
And now only leaves are up there, chipping off

476
00:57:01,227 --> 00:57:04,603
The spring has now met its end

477
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:00,047
When the alarm clock rang,

478
00:59:01,119 --> 00:59:03,479
I finally woke up

479
00:59:04,535 --> 00:59:08,591
The flu I had yesterday doesn’t seem real anymore

480
00:59:11,023 --> 00:59:16,719
I think of going out, but, ah, the forecast says it looks like rain

481
00:59:17,310 --> 00:59:19,439
Well, I couldn’t go anyway

482
00:59:20,591 --> 00:59:22,862
because it’s still dark

483
00:59:23,863 --> 00:59:25,951
A dry throat,

484
00:59:26,935 --> 00:59:29,143
a hurting heart–

485
00:59:30,183 --> 00:59:32,230
all these human thing

486
00:59:32,799 --> 00:59:34,527
are getting in my way

487
00:59:38,287 --> 00:59:46,303
Lift your head at the speed of the farewell

488
00:59:46,799 --> 00:59:50,487
Someday dawn will finally break

489
00:59:50,663 --> 00:59:55,015
Come on, try and open your eyes

490
00:59:55,735 --> 01:00:03,686
Because I’ve pictured your sleepy eyes so many times

491
01:00:17,142 --> 01:00:22,895
I finally decided to take an umbrella and go out anyway,

492
01:00:23,550 --> 01:00:25,582
which was good, but

493
01:00:26,926 --> 01:00:29,431
I think I might’ve thrown away my shoes

494
01:00:30,431 --> 01:00:36,623
And it’s not like I’ve got the courage to go barefoot so…

495
01:00:36,886 --> 01:00:39,391
I guess I don’t really care?

496
01:00:40,134 --> 01:00:42,303
What do I want to do?

497
01:00:43,487 --> 01:00:46,095
What should I do for dinner?

498
01:00:46,655 --> 01:00:49,015
If the rain lets up, I’ll go out

499
01:00:49,703 --> 01:00:54,615
Even though I don’t really want to see people

500
01:00:58,399 --> 01:01:06,255
At this speed I swim through today,

501
01:01:06,639 --> 01:01:09,950
And if my hand finally touches you…

502
01:01:10,439 --> 01:01:14,831
Come on, try and open your eyes

503
01:01:15,558 --> 01:01:19,295
Because I remember you and your sleepy eyes,

504
01:01:19,631 --> 01:01:23,334
even though I’ve forgotten them

505
01:01:24,806 --> 01:01:28,295
There you are by the hill,

506
01:01:28,719 --> 01:01:31,086
laughing, “It’s been so long, hasn’t it?”

507
01:01:32,015 --> 01:01:34,719
as you bring your face close to mine

508
01:01:34,975 --> 01:01:37,575
“Let’s go together,” you say

509
01:01:38,406 --> 01:01:41,127
Under a barn in Lapland

510
01:01:41,462 --> 01:01:44,055
On the old streets of Gamlastan

511
01:01:44,543 --> 01:01:48,839
The summer grass is getting in my way

512
01:01:52,959 --> 01:02:01,527
At this speed I swim through today,

513
01:02:01,775 --> 01:02:05,118
And if my hand finally touches you…

514
01:02:05,366 --> 01:02:08,415
Come on, open your eyes

515
01:02:09,214 --> 01:02:14,606
And see that I’ve forgotten you

516
01:02:16,095 --> 01:02:24,127
Lift your head at the speed of the farewell

517
01:02:24,535 --> 01:02:28,207
Someday dawn will finally break...

518
01:02:28,567 --> 01:02:31,519
Come on, open your eyes

519
01:02:31,911 --> 01:02:41,631
And see that I’ve drawn pictures of your sleepy eyes so many times

520
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:41,737
I know I'm a liar, I admit it

521
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:45,553
still, still Elma it hurts

522
01:03:46,071 --> 01:03:49,249
even though it's time to say goodbye

523
01:03:49,479 --> 01:03:55,161
I'll sing until the darkening night arrives

524
01:04:10,824 --> 01:04:15,265
Me and Elma, in the morning sunlight shining through the trees

525
01:04:15,527 --> 01:04:18,345
are you still sleepy?

526
01:04:18,711 --> 01:04:24,137
as the early summer begins, we approach the forest of May

527
01:04:27,055 --> 01:04:31,881
Walking with the dew from the flowers on our faces

528
01:04:32,087 --> 01:04:34,993
see, they're like tear drops

529
01:04:35,255 --> 01:04:38,105
Let's yawn like this

530
01:04:38,391 --> 01:04:42,945
if you want we can even sit in a chair

531
01:04:43,551 --> 01:04:47,609
There's nothing that can't be forgiven

532
01:04:47,887 --> 01:04:51,881
you can become kinder

533
01:04:53,831 --> 01:05:03,201
Like this, in some far away country

534
01:05:04,255 --> 01:05:08,999
lying sprawled out in a shallow summer

535
01:05:10,199 --> 01:05:19,208
without shedding tears or saying words

536
01:05:20,623 --> 01:05:25,545
without simply knowing the deepness of the night

537
01:05:27,247 --> 01:05:30,881
I know I'm a liar, I admit it

538
01:05:31,183 --> 01:05:34,969
still, still Elma it hurts

539
01:05:35,343 --> 01:05:38,289
even though it's time to say goodbye

540
01:05:38,567 --> 01:05:44,625
I'll sing until the darkening night arrives

541
01:06:00,112 --> 01:06:07,866
if you don't see difficult or painful things you won't understand them

542
01:06:08,327 --> 01:06:11,949
with your eyes closed you ran away

543
01:06:12,367 --> 01:06:15,999
walking a moonlit path

544
01:06:16,503 --> 01:06:20,282
cramped rooms, cold nights

545
01:06:20,535 --> 01:06:24,410
sleepy afternoons, lonely mornings

546
01:06:24,878 --> 01:06:32,188
in the words of farewell, I'm looking at your face

547
01:06:37,343 --> 01:06:46,393
Like this, in some far away country

548
01:06:47,807 --> 01:06:53,173
lying sprawled out in a shallow summer

549
01:06:54,319 --> 01:07:03,609
without shedding tears or saying words

550
01:07:04,503 --> 01:07:09,329
simply looking at the blueness of the sky

551
01:07:12,727 --> 01:07:17,873
simply not knowing of the ending between us

552
01:07:19,527 --> 01:07:23,169
I know I'm a liar, I admit it

553
01:07:23,375 --> 01:07:26,999
still, still Elma it hurts

554
01:07:27,463 --> 01:07:30,569
even though it's time to say goodbye

555
01:07:30,791 --> 01:07:36,593
I'll sing until the darkening night arrives

556
01:11:06,300 --> 01:11:09,723
In a rain-drenched playground, 

557
01:11:11,472 --> 01:11:15,379
I remembered yesterday’s fireworks,

558
01:11:16,404 --> 01:11:21,772
Your distracted face from that time, 

559
01:11:21,987 --> 01:11:27,788
and the scent of summer still on the wind.

560
01:11:48,988 --> 01:11:51,204
Fall comes, 

561
01:11:51,619 --> 01:11:53,541
winter comes,

562
01:11:53,604 --> 01:11:55,876
After we finished 

563
01:11:56,492 --> 01:11:58,972
our long slumber

564
01:11:59,580 --> 01:12:01,928
Riding the clouds, 

565
01:12:02,244 --> 01:12:04,315
riding the wind,

566
01:12:04,676 --> 01:12:07,536
Let’s go far away, 

567
01:12:08,324 --> 01:12:11,723
there’s nothing for us here.

568
01:12:33,635 --> 01:12:38,364
In a playground where flowers fluttered, 

569
01:12:39,155 --> 01:12:43,971
I remembered yesterday’s sunset,

570
01:12:44,852 --> 01:12:49,324
Your cold, transparent self from that time, 

571
01:12:49,667 --> 01:12:56,435
and summer still lingering on your cheeks.

572
01:13:17,032 --> 01:13:19,484
Spring comes,

573
01:13:20,032 --> 01:13:21,984
summer comes,

574
01:13:22,116 --> 01:13:24,507
When we awakened 

575
01:13:24,876 --> 01:13:26,872
from our deep slumber

576
01:13:27,980 --> 01:13:30,144
Becoming water, 

577
01:13:30,683 --> 01:13:32,675
becoming flowers

578
01:13:33,108 --> 01:13:35,356
Let’s gaze at the sky, 

579
01:13:36,667 --> 01:13:40,276
we don’t need anything like words.

580
01:13:43,356 --> 01:13:45,280
There’s no such thing as gods,

581
01:13:45,595 --> 01:13:48,239
And realizing our dreams is a lie,

582
01:13:48,485 --> 01:13:51,708
So let’s put a stop to work and school.

583
01:13:54,068 --> 01:13:56,508
If it’s natural to forget things,

584
01:13:56,668 --> 01:13:59,580
Don't create words for these memories

585
01:13:60,012 --> 01:14:03,436
Let’s seal our mouths so we don’t forget.

586
01:14:06,436 --> 01:14:08,499
I’ll wait for you, 

587
01:14:09,460 --> 01:14:11,267
as summer passes,

588
01:14:11,892 --> 01:14:14,211
Someday, when 

589
01:14:14,603 --> 01:14:16,300
we can see the end

590
01:14:17,684 --> 01:14:19,564
Riding the clouds, 

591
01:14:20,428 --> 01:14:22,580
riding the wind

592
01:14:23,027 --> 01:14:25,148
Like we’re sleeping, 

593
01:14:27,051 --> 01:14:28,428
just…

594
01:14:28,996 --> 01:14:30,340
Fall comes, 

595
01:14:31,252 --> 01:14:33,300
winter comes,

596
01:14:34,020 --> 01:14:36,492
After we finished 

597
01:14:37,236 --> 01:14:38,156
our long slumber

598
01:14:39,924 --> 01:14:41,484
Riding the clouds, 

599
01:14:42,411 --> 01:14:44,131
riding the wind,

600
01:14:44,835 --> 01:14:47,219
Let’s go far away,

601
01:14:48,388 --> 01:14:51,892
There’s nothing for us here.

602
01:14:59,095 --> 01:15:02,932
I want to live with you alone.

603
01:15:11,003 --> 01:15:15,091
I want to live with you alone.

604
01:15:22,184 --> 01:15:26,212
I want to live with you alone.
