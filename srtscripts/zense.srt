1
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:40,756
The scenery doesn’t change; on a faded afternoon

2
00:02:41,443 --> 00:02:46,892
I’m lying in the deep indigo beneath the overpass

3
00:02:49,155 --> 00:02:53,860
I hear a single clap for my blank-page life

4
00:02:54,732 --> 00:03:00,491
I was singing about my own emptiness today, as usual

5
00:03:20,979 --> 00:03:22,003
So things wouldn’t change,

6
00:03:22,827 --> 00:03:29,283
I wrote a story starring you in my notebook

7
00:03:31,307 --> 00:03:36,691
My gas and water being cut off, society, and the news are all someone else’s problem

8
00:03:37,883 --> 00:03:39,620
Look, my life is like ink

9
00:03:40,387 --> 00:03:53,228
The dream I had when I was young gets closer to its expiration date as I get older

10
00:03:53,587 --> 00:03:58,539
Though I just, I just look up at the clouds

11
00:03:58,908 --> 00:04:03,435
As usual, they flow through my field of vision

12
00:04:04,275 --> 00:04:08,627
In the distant night sky I looked up at, flowers swam

13
00:04:09,251 --> 00:04:12,891
So many that it could be mistaken for spring

14
00:04:13,396 --> 00:04:17,820
As if I’d just lost sight of you

15
00:04:37,708 --> 00:04:40,315
I looked down so I wouldn’t trip

16
00:04:40,916 --> 00:04:45,467
Life is made of nothing but compromises

17
00:04:47,884 --> 00:04:52,204
I don’t believe in hearts or fate or love songs or life

18
00:04:52,868 --> 00:04:55,388
After all, if you can’t sell something it has no value

19
00:04:56,747 --> 00:05:09,708
I intentionally discarded the present I dreamed of, and now I’m lying here waiting for its expiration date

20
00:05:10,075 --> 00:05:14,803
Behind my eyelids, I just, I just saw

21
00:05:15,172 --> 00:05:19,532
An imagined, distant vision of you

22
00:05:20,348 --> 00:05:24,707
In my notebook, flowers swim in the corner of a faded night

23
00:05:25,540 --> 00:05:28,267
One more is in my eye

24
00:05:30,468 --> 00:05:33,075
Life is just one compromise after another

25
00:05:33,315 --> 00:05:35,451
I learned that pretty fast

26
00:05:35,708 --> 00:05:36,891
Elma, it’s you

27
00:05:38,515 --> 00:05:40,283
You alone are my music

28
00:05:41,388 --> 00:05:43,811
There are only eighty more characters in this song

29
00:05:44,311 --> 00:05:50,892
Because maybe the only value of a life is in the way it ends

30
00:05:55,668 --> 00:05:59,851
I just, I just picture you

31
00:06:00,851 --> 00:06:04,451
As even the indigo filling my vision is blurred

32
00:06:05,380 --> 00:06:09,700
In the distant sky I looked up at, flowers swam

33
00:06:10,332 --> 00:06:13,659
Deep indigo covers my eyes

34
00:06:15,187 --> 00:06:18,996
It’s just, it’s just…

35
00:06:25,716 --> 00:06:30,283
In the distant sky I looked up at, you are cooling off

36
00:06:35,172 --> 00:06:38,923
As if you were just swimming in the night

37
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:33,267
I’ve thought about it, but I still don’t understand

38
00:07:33,955 --> 00:07:35,467
Under the blue sky, I waited for you

39
00:07:36,052 --> 00:07:38,692
On that breezy afternoon, my imagination escaped the confines of the day

40
00:07:39,036 --> 00:07:41,076
Hey, where do I go from here?

41
00:07:41,636 --> 00:07:43,091
No one has told me how to proceed

42
00:07:43,715 --> 00:07:46,724
I looked into your eyes and without a word I walked away

43
00:08:03,316 --> 00:08:04,755
I’ve thought about it, but I still don’t understand

44
00:08:05,219 --> 00:08:06,660
Youth is so boring

45
00:08:07,148 --> 00:08:10,419
I tried to give up piano, but I can’t break the habit of playing on my desk*

46
00:08:10,748 --> 00:08:12,500
Hey, what will I do in the future?

47
00:08:12,851 --> 00:08:14,411
It shouldn’t be music, right?

48
00:08:16,596 --> 00:08:17,355
Don’t worry

49
00:08:17,987 --> 00:08:25,779
Even if I plucked a single string in my heart

50
00:08:26,187 --> 00:08:29,172
No matter what I did, it wouldn’t disappear, even now, so

51
00:08:29,691 --> 00:08:32,764
Hey, I still remember

52
00:08:33,507 --> 00:08:34,523
I’m mistaken

53
00:08:34,875 --> 00:08:36,724
I don’t understand, I don’t care

54
00:08:37,475 --> 00:08:41,188
About all you humans or the truth or love or the world or pain or life

55
00:08:41,524 --> 00:08:44,668
Wanting to know what’s right or wrong is just a self-preservation instinct

56
00:08:45,228 --> 00:08:47,468
It’s your fault that I thought that

57
00:09:03,796 --> 00:09:07,219
I’ve thought about it, but I still don’t understand why I truly don’t want to get older

58
00:09:07,741 --> 00:09:11,204
Just thinking “Someday I’m going to die” makes my chest feel hollow

59
00:09:11,691 --> 00:09:13,155
“What will I do in the future?”

60
00:09:13,619 --> 00:09:18,699
When I grew up I understood That I’m not going to do anything at all

61
00:09:19,244 --> 00:09:28,467
How do I explain why I hate people who put on happy faces?

62
00:09:28,996 --> 00:09:35,868
It’s an inferiority complex haunting my unsatisfied mind like a ghost

63
00:09:36,411 --> 00:09:37,332
I’m not mistaken

64
00:09:37,683 --> 00:09:39,619
Hey, with all your differences, you all are human

65
00:09:40,324 --> 00:09:44,068
When you don’t have love or salvation or kindness or a foundation, it feels bad

66
00:09:44,611 --> 00:09:47,467
Feeling pain at something like a love song is a self-preservation instinct

67
00:09:48,451 --> 00:09:50,683
Do I really not care? It’s your fault

68
00:10:06,931 --> 00:10:08,339
I’ve thought about it, but I still don’t understand

69
00:10:08,851 --> 00:10:10,348
Why just living is painful

70
00:10:10,844 --> 00:10:12,404
Why you can’t make a living from something like music

71
00:10:12,884 --> 00:10:14,371
I don’t care if the lyrics or whatever are lazily done

72
00:10:18,132 --> 00:10:19,235
I don’t care about anything

73
00:10:21,924 --> 00:10:23,412
I’m probably not mistaken

74
00:10:26,076 --> 00:10:27,435
I’m sure I’m not mistaken

75
00:10:30,476 --> 00:10:31,579
I’m sure I’m not mistaken

76
00:10:43,419 --> 00:10:44,812
I’m mistaken, I understand

77
00:10:45,219 --> 00:10:46,899
I don’t care

78
00:10:47,516 --> 00:10:51,316
About all you humans or the truth or love or salvation or kindness or life

79
00:10:51,651 --> 00:10:54,684
Not being able to give the right answer is a self-preservation instinct

80
00:10:55,467 --> 00:10:57,588
I don’t care, it’s your fault

81
00:11:16,235 --> 00:11:17,716
Even I had faith in something once

82
00:11:18,356 --> 00:11:19,515
Now the feeling is nothing but garbage

83
00:11:20,187 --> 00:11:21,220
I wrote to you so many times

84
00:11:21,764 --> 00:11:23,931
I didn’t care about whether I’d be rich and famous

85
00:11:25,484 --> 00:11:25,868
It’s true,

86
00:11:25,948 --> 00:11:26,988
it’s really true,

87
00:11:28,683 --> 00:11:30,419
that’s how it was back then

88
00:11:30,987 --> 00:11:33,447
That’s why I

89
00:11:35,291 --> 00:11:38,380
That’s why I gave up on music
