122
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:38,883
I’ve thought about it, but I still don’t understand

123
00:16:39,211 --> 00:16:39,403
Under the blue sky, I waited for you

124
00:16:39,579 --> 00:16:39,963
On that breezy afternoon, my imagination escaped the confines of the day

125
00:16:40,315 --> 00:16:40,723
Hey, where do I go from here?

126
00:16:41,123 --> 00:16:41,467
No one has told me how to proceed

127
00:16:41,843 --> 00:16:42,170
I looked into your eyes and without a word I walked away

128
00:16:42,555 --> 00:16:42,947
I’ve thought about it, but I still don’t understand

129
00:16:46,690 --> 00:16:46,995
Youth is so boring

130
00:16:47,203 --> 00:16:47,716
I tried to give up piano, but I can’t break the habit of playing on my desk*

131
00:16:47,748 --> 00:16:47,779
Hey, what will I do in the future?

132
00:16:47,811 --> 00:16:47,842
It shouldn’t be music, right?

133
00:16:47,872 --> 00:16:47,904
Don’t worry

134
00:16:47,935 --> 00:16:47,982
Even if I plucked a single string in my heart

135
00:16:48,012 --> 00:16:48,045
No matter what I did, it wouldn’t disappear, even now, so

136
00:16:48,075 --> 00:16:48,106
Hey, I still remember

137
00:16:48,138 --> 00:16:48,169
I’m mistaken

138
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:48,231
I don’t understand, I don’t care

139
00:16:48,277 --> 00:16:48,308
About all you humans or the truth or love or the world or pain or life

140
00:16:48,338 --> 00:16:48,370
Wanting to know what’s right or wrong is just a self-preservation instinct

141
00:16:48,401 --> 00:16:48,432
It’s your fault that I thought that

142
00:16:48,462 --> 00:16:48,509
I’ve thought about it, but I still don’t understand why I truly don’t want to get older

143
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:48,569
Just thinking “Someday I’m going to die” makes my chest feel hollow

144
00:16:48,601 --> 00:16:48,633
“What will I do in the future?”

145
00:16:48,664 --> 00:16:48,695
When I grew up I understood That I’m not going to do anything at all

146
00:16:48,727 --> 00:16:48,774
How do I explain why I hate people who put on happy faces?

147
00:16:48,804 --> 00:16:48,837
It’s an inferiority complex haunting my unsatisfied mind like a ghost

148
00:16:48,867 --> 00:16:48,898
I’m not mistaken

149
00:16:48,929 --> 00:16:48,959
Hey, with all your differences, you all are human

150
00:16:49,005 --> 00:16:49,036
When you don’t have love or salvation or kindness or a foundation, it feels bad

151
00:16:49,067 --> 00:16:49,098
Feeling pain at something like a love song is a self-preservation instinct

152
00:16:49,129 --> 00:16:49,160
Do I really not care? It’s your fault

153
00:16:49,191 --> 00:16:49,224
I’ve thought about it, but I still don’t understand

154
00:16:49,255 --> 00:16:49,302
Why just living is painful

155
00:16:49,333 --> 00:16:49,365
Why you can’t make a living from something like music

156
00:16:49,395 --> 00:16:49,427
I don’t care if the lyrics or whatever are lazily done

157
00:16:49,457 --> 00:16:49,488
I don’t care about anything

158
00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:49,565
I’m probably not mistaken

159
00:16:49,596 --> 00:16:49,627
I’m sure I’m not mistaken

160
00:16:49,658 --> 00:16:49,689
I’m sure I’m not mistaken

161
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:49,751
I’m mistaken, I understand

162
00:16:49,797 --> 00:16:49,828
I don’t care

163
00:16:49,859 --> 00:16:49,890
About all you humans or the truth or love or salvation or kindness or life

164
00:16:49,922 --> 00:16:49,951
Not being able to give the right answer is a self-preservation instinct

165
00:16:49,982 --> 00:16:50,027
I don’t care, it’s your fault

166
00:16:50,058 --> 00:16:50,091
Even I had faith in something once

167
00:16:50,121 --> 00:16:50,152
Now the feeling is nothing but garbage

168
00:16:50,183 --> 00:16:50,214
I wrote to you so many times

169
00:16:50,246 --> 00:16:50,277
I didn’t care about whether I’d be rich and famous

170
00:16:50,323 --> 00:16:50,355
It’s true,

171
00:16:50,386 --> 00:16:50,416
it’s really true,

172
00:16:50,447 --> 00:16:50,478
that’s how it was back then

173
00:16:50,510 --> 00:16:50,555
That’s why I

174
00:16:50,586 --> 00:16:50,618
That’s why I gave up on music
