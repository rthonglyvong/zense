400
00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:29,343
Setting aside my goodbye and holding a flower,

401
00:46:30,104 --> 00:46:33,439
An uncertain sun dawned outside

402
00:46:34,088 --> 00:46:36,799
I woke up in an empty room,

403
00:46:37,687 --> 00:46:41,408
Leaving behind a piece of warmth.

404
00:46:57,887 --> 00:47:04,823
I can’t remember what happened last night, not even a little bit,

405
00:47:05,631 --> 00:47:11,880
But I just have this feeling that someone else was there.

406
00:47:13,199 --> 00:47:20,247
My head’s not spinning, but I have a hangover

407
00:47:21,143 --> 00:47:27,263
Even though I don’t understand, that’s beautiful in itself.

408
00:47:28,495 --> 00:47:35,119
A toothbrush on the counter, someone’s cup, skin lotion,

409
00:47:35,407 --> 00:47:38,687
Everything I can’t remember,

410
00:47:39,150 --> 00:47:42,791
And the scent of flowers on my pillow

411
00:47:43,119 --> 00:47:47,135
Setting aside my goodbye and holding a flower,

412
00:47:47,575 --> 00:47:51,383
An uncertain sun dawned outside

413
00:47:51,871 --> 00:47:55,119
I’m waking up in an empty room,

414
00:47:55,519 --> 00:47:59,271
Leaving behind a piece of warmth.

415
00:48:15,808 --> 00:48:22,895
I don’t remember last night that well,

416
00:48:23,647 --> 00:48:29,976
But I don’t feel like I fell for a badger game either.

417
00:48:31,479 --> 00:48:38,591
My hangover cleared and I thought about it,

418
00:48:39,423 --> 00:48:42,095
But I’m fine with not understanding –

419
00:48:42,415 --> 00:48:45,247
If anything, I prefer it that way.

420
00:48:46,863 --> 00:48:53,527
A lavender blooming by the window, a dirty sink, a knitted muffler,

421
00:48:53,791 --> 00:48:56,768
Everything I can’t remember,

422
00:48:57,479 --> 00:49:01,168
And the scent of spring in the room

423
00:49:01,455 --> 00:49:05,495
Grasping at the drifting clouds like a game,

424
00:49:06,215 --> 00:49:09,807
The day grew dark like no one was coming.

425
00:49:10,240 --> 00:49:13,583
The setting sun shone through a window,

426
00:49:13,887 --> 00:49:17,471
Leaving me behind without a clue.

427
00:49:34,215 --> 00:49:41,119
I actually remember a bit of last night,

428
00:49:41,815 --> 00:49:47,663
And about continuing a life without you in it.

429
00:49:49,399 --> 00:49:56,519
Even now, I can only think of this one thing,

430
00:49:57,360 --> 00:50:03,871
How you disappeared and left me holding a flower.

431
00:50:08,183 --> 00:50:11,159
Surely you’ll come back tomorrow,

432
00:50:11,823 --> 00:50:15,103
Coming home like nothing ever happened.

433
00:50:15,688 --> 00:50:20,310
I can hear you opening the door now,

434
00:50:20,559 --> 00:50:23,199
Saying, “sorry for being late.”

435
00:50:23,543 --> 00:50:27,063
I’ve been waiting for just those words,

436
00:50:27,431 --> 00:50:31,071
Waiting intently for the sunset…

437
00:50:39,879 --> 00:50:44,007
Before I forget it all, I’ll draw a flower

438
00:50:44,247 --> 00:50:48,423
Once again, I’m alone at night

439
00:50:48,671 --> 00:50:49,015
Falling asleep in an empty room,

440
00:50:52,183 --> 00:50:55,847
As you leave your warmth on me.

441
00:50:56,287 --> 00:50:59,407
Like a fool, I’m holding a flower

442
00:50:59,903 --> 00:51:03,631
As spring comes to this room once again

443
00:51:04,095 --> 00:51:07,231
I’m living in a town without you in it,

444
00:51:07,559 --> 00:51:11,359
As you leave your warmth on me -

445
00:51:11,671 --> 00:51:15,647
As you leave a single flower to me.

446
00:51:20,430 --> 00:51:25,271
I’ve been waiting for just those words,

447
00:51:28,191 --> 00:51:33,511
Waiting intently for the sunset…
