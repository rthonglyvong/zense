500
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:00,047
When the alarm clock rang,

501
00:59:01,119 --> 00:59:03,479
I finally woke up

502
00:59:04,535 --> 00:59:08,591
The flu I had yesterday doesn’t seem real anymore

503
00:59:11,023 --> 00:59:16,719
I think of going out, but, ah, the forecast says it looks like rain

504
00:59:17,310 --> 00:59:19,439
Well, I couldn’t go anyway

505
00:59:20,591 --> 00:59:22,862
because it’s still dark

506
00:59:23,863 --> 00:59:25,951
A dry throat,

507
00:59:26,935 --> 00:59:29,143
a hurting heart–

508
00:59:30,183 --> 00:59:32,230
all these human thing

509
00:59:32,799 --> 00:59:34,527
are getting in my way

510
00:59:38,287 --> 00:59:46,303
Lift your head at the speed of the farewell

511
00:59:46,799 --> 00:59:50,487
Someday dawn will finally break

512
00:59:50,663 --> 00:59:55,015
Come on, try and open your eyes

513
00:59:55,735 --> 01:00:03,686
Because I’ve pictured your sleepy eyes so many times

514
01:00:17,142 --> 01:00:22,895
I finally decided to take an umbrella and go out anyway,

515
01:00:23,550 --> 01:00:25,582
which was good, but

516
01:00:26,926 --> 01:00:29,431
I think I might’ve thrown away my shoes

517
01:00:30,431 --> 01:00:36,623
And it’s not like I’ve got the courage to go barefoot so…

518
01:00:36,886 --> 01:00:39,391
I guess I don’t really care?

519
01:00:40,134 --> 01:00:42,303
What do I want to do?

520
01:00:43,487 --> 01:00:46,095
What should I do for dinner?

521
01:00:46,655 --> 01:00:49,015
If the rain lets up, I’ll go out

522
01:00:49,703 --> 01:00:54,615
Even though I don’t really want to see people

523
01:00:58,399 --> 01:01:06,255
At this speed I swim through today,

524
01:01:06,639 --> 01:01:09,950
And if my hand finally touches you…

525
01:01:10,439 --> 01:01:14,831
Come on, try and open your eyes

526
01:01:15,558 --> 01:01:19,295
Because I remember you and your sleepy eyes,

527
01:01:19,631 --> 01:01:23,334
even though I’ve forgotten them

528
01:01:24,806 --> 01:01:28,295
There you are by the hill,

529
01:01:28,719 --> 01:01:31,086
laughing, “It’s been so long, hasn’t it?”

530
01:01:32,015 --> 01:01:34,719
as you bring your face close to mine

531
01:01:34,975 --> 01:01:37,575
“Let’s go together,” you say

532
01:01:38,406 --> 01:01:41,127
Under a barn in Lapland

533
01:01:41,462 --> 01:01:44,055
On the old streets of Gamlastan

534
01:01:44,543 --> 01:01:48,839
The summer grass is getting in my way

535
01:01:52,959 --> 01:02:01,527
At this speed I swim through today,

536
01:02:01,775 --> 01:02:05,118
And if my hand finally touches you…

537
01:02:05,366 --> 01:02:08,415
Come on, open your eyes

538
01:02:09,214 --> 01:02:14,606
And see that I’ve forgotten you

539
01:02:16,095 --> 01:02:24,127
Lift your head at the speed of the farewell

540
01:02:24,535 --> 01:02:28,207
Someday dawn will finally break...

541
01:02:28,567 --> 01:02:31,519
Come on, open your eyes

542
01:02:31,911 --> 01:02:41,631
And see that I’ve drawn pictures of your sleepy eyes so many times
