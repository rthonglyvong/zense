350
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:49,129
You, who are so kind to others, could never understand this heart of mine.

351
00:41:49,872 --> 00:41:54,040
I enjoy cursing others, that used to be why I wrote songs.

352
00:41:55,288 --> 00:41:59,320
I had dreamt of being featured in the morning news, someday;

353
00:42:00,040 --> 00:42:03,200
for that reason, I sharpen my knife.

354
00:42:04,736 --> 00:42:07,240
The sound of glass being smashed,

355
00:42:07,584 --> 00:42:09,664
the act of ripping apart some kind of paper,

356
00:42:10,097 --> 00:42:13,472
the setting sun after a farewell –

357
00:42:15,192 --> 00:42:16,656
surely, even you understand that they're beautiful, right?

358
00:42:17,144 --> 00:42:21,728
The crows' song is dyed a deep red,

359
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:26,896
and this loneliness, too, turns into sound.

360
00:42:27,232 --> 00:42:31,272
In the last traces of the dusk in my memory

361
00:42:31,528 --> 00:42:36,176
You stand on your tiptoes; the clouds burn red,

362
00:42:36,616 --> 00:42:40,768
and the word "goodbye" slips from my mouth

363
00:43:00,928 --> 00:43:03,008
I want to be acknowledged, I want to love–

364
00:43:03,264 --> 00:43:05,072
are these what they call "dreams?"

365
00:43:05,471 --> 00:43:07,384
Even if I do nothing to achieve them, let them come true.

366
00:43:07,776 --> 00:43:09,896
Hurry up and gratify me.

367
00:43:10,952 --> 00:43:15,136
Society, which is so kind to others, could never understand this envy.

368
00:43:15,351 --> 00:43:18,920
I'm always looking for an opportunity to hit someone.

369
00:43:20,968 --> 00:43:25,584
A streetlight struck by a bottle of beer, the sound of a guitar breaking after being thrown;

370
00:43:25,880 --> 00:43:29,232
all these irreparable regrets are beautiful—

371
00:43:29,632 --> 00:43:32,544
That said, even I understand! And yet...

372
00:43:32,824 --> 00:43:37,600
I'm struck by a rain of words,

373
00:43:37,816 --> 00:43:42,744
and winter tumbles down on me even as I hold autumn dearly in my arms.

374
00:43:43,024 --> 00:43:47,224
From behind the mountain in spring,

375
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:51,784
one more breath of smoke drifts upwards—

376
00:43:52,560 --> 00:43:56,536
and the summer breeze slips across my cheek.

377
00:44:06,848 --> 00:44:10,856
You, who are so kind to others, could never understand this loneliness of mine.

378
00:44:11,240 --> 00:44:13,552
I don't want to die, but I can't go on living;

379
00:44:13,928 --> 00:44:15,551
that's why I write songs.

380
00:44:16,984 --> 00:44:21,512
I think disparagement, disappointment, and disgust have all have their eyes on me.

381
00:44:22,040 --> 00:44:24,808
That's why I write songs that hurt people.

382
00:44:27,288 --> 00:44:30,048
That's why I write vapid songs such as this.

383
00:44:33,696 --> 00:44:38,616
I want to swallow your words.

384
00:44:38,960 --> 00:44:42,176
I don't even have anything to put them in,

385
00:44:42,392 --> 00:44:44,008
so I use both my hands.

386
00:44:44,320 --> 00:44:48,720
Before i know it my throat will get wet,

387
00:44:49,088 --> 00:44:53,264
And while I wait for that time to come...

388
00:44:54,288 --> 00:44:59,176
The crows' song is dyed a deep red,

389
00:44:59,488 --> 00:45:04,352
and I plead for this loneliness to transform into song.

390
00:45:04,631 --> 00:45:08,672
The word "goodbye" dyes you a deep red,

391
00:45:08,904 --> 00:45:13,904
and, now, I wait for the night.

392
00:45:13,568 --> 00:45:17,536
The words "see you tomorrow" slip off my mouth.
