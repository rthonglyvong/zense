122
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:41,260
If there’s a heart inside my body, 

123
00:16:42,900 --> 00:16:45,613
right below my throat,

124
00:16:47,404 --> 00:16:57,436
Then that must be where you are

125
00:17:15,108 --> 00:17:22,580
I’ve known for a long time

126
00:17:24,092 --> 00:17:32,564
That as I got older I would even forget your face

127
00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:36,348
Because I want to know 

128
00:17:37,956 --> 00:17:40,868
the moment that words are able to form

129
00:17:42,573 --> 00:17:47,524
inside my body, 

130
00:17:48,972 --> 00:17:51,324
in my throat

131
00:17:51,996 --> 00:17:57,844
If the dawn comes like this…

132
00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:04,084
I hope that my memories don’t dry out

133
00:18:04,476 --> 00:18:08,348
I hope that I don’t lose this song

134
00:18:09,156 --> 00:18:11,268
Don’t forget, 

135
00:18:11,988 --> 00:18:15,444
for just a little longer,

136
00:18:18,524 --> 00:18:23,420
The lonely parade

137
00:18:40,724 --> 00:18:48,308
I’ve thought for a long time that

138
00:18:49,876 --> 00:18:59,371
Gods might reside in your fingertips

139
00:18:59,780 --> 00:19:01,852
Since before today, 

140
00:19:03,756 --> 00:19:06,956
before yesterday, 

141
00:19:08,372 --> 00:19:14,076
since a long, long time past

142
00:19:17,484 --> 00:19:21,284
I’ve known that

143
00:19:54,716 --> 00:19:57,772
Inside my body, 

144
00:19:59,252 --> 00:20:02,332
right below my throat

145
00:20:03,844 --> 00:20:12,412
Are the days when I’ve only been imitating your song

146
00:20:14,244 --> 00:20:16,836
I hope that I don’t forget

147
00:20:23,404 --> 00:20:28,060
The temperature of this moment in which you’re not here

148
00:20:32,813 --> 00:20:37,036
With memories that I hope won’t dry out

149
00:20:37,348 --> 00:20:41,636
With this song that I haven’t been able to forget

150
00:20:42,164 --> 00:20:44,468
Just a little bit more, 

151
00:20:45,060 --> 00:20:48,844
for just a little longer

152
00:20:53,900 --> 00:20:59,004
I’ll make a lonely parade
