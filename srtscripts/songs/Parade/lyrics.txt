If there’s a heart inside my body, 
right below my throat,
Then that must be where you are
 
I’ve known for a long time
That as I got older I would even forget your face
Because I want to know 
the moment that words are able to form
inside my body, 
in my throat
 
If the dawn comes like this…
 
I hope that my memories don’t dry out
I hope that I don’t lose this song
Don’t forget, 
for just a little longer,
The lonely parade
 
I’ve thought for a long time that
Gods might reside in your fingertips
Since before today, 
before yesterday, 
since a long, long time past
I’ve known that
 
Inside my body, 
right below my throat
Are the days when I’ve only been imitating your song
 
I hope that I don’t forget
The temperature of this moment in which you’re not here
 
With memories that I hope won’t dry out
With this song that I haven’t been able to forget
Just a little bit more, 
for just a little longer
I’ll make a lonely parade
