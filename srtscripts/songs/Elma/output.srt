500
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:41,687
I know I'm a liar, I admit it

501
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:45,503
still, still Elma it hurts

502
01:03:46,071 --> 01:03:49,199
even though it's time to say goodbye

503
01:03:49,479 --> 01:03:55,111
I'll sing until the darkening night arrives

504
01:04:10,824 --> 01:04:15,215
Me and Elma, in the morning sunlight shining through the trees

505
01:04:15,527 --> 01:04:18,295
are you still sleepy?

506
01:04:18,711 --> 01:04:24,087
as the early summer begins, we approach the forest of May

507
01:04:27,055 --> 01:04:31,831
Walking with the dew from the flowers on our faces

508
01:04:32,087 --> 01:04:34,943
see, they're like tear drops

509
01:04:35,255 --> 01:04:38,055
Let's yawn like this

510
01:04:38,391 --> 01:04:42,895
if you want we can even sit in a chair

511
01:04:43,551 --> 01:04:47,559
There's nothing that can't be forgiven

512
01:04:47,887 --> 01:04:51,831
you can become kinder

513
01:04:53,831 --> 01:05:03,151
Like this, in some far away country

514
01:05:04,255 --> 01:05:08,951
lying sprawled out in a shallow summer

515
01:05:10,199 --> 01:05:19,158
without shedding tears or saying words

516
01:05:20,623 --> 01:05:25,495
without simply knowing the deepness of the night

517
01:05:27,247 --> 01:05:30,831
I know I'm a liar, I admit it

518
01:05:31,183 --> 01:05:34,919
still, still Elma it hurts

519
01:05:35,343 --> 01:05:38,239
even though it's time to say goodbye

520
01:05:38,567 --> 01:05:44,575
I'll sing until the darkening night arrives

521
01:06:00,112 --> 01:06:07,816
if you don't see difficult or painful things you won't understand them

522
01:06:08,327 --> 01:06:11,999
with your eyes closed you ran away

523
01:06:12,367 --> 01:06:15,951
walking a moonlit path

524
01:06:16,503 --> 01:06:20,232
cramped rooms, cold nights

525
01:06:20,535 --> 01:06:24,360
sleepy afternoons, lonely mornings

526
01:06:24,878 --> 01:06:32,038
in the words of farewell, I'm looking at your face

527
01:06:37,343 --> 01:06:46,343
Like this, in some far away country

528
01:06:47,807 --> 01:06:53,023
lying sprawled out in a shallow summer

529
01:06:54,319 --> 01:07:03,559
without shedding tears or saying words

530
01:07:04,503 --> 01:07:09,279
simply looking at the blueness of the sky

531
01:07:12,727 --> 01:07:17,823
simply not knowing of the ending between us

532
01:07:19,527 --> 01:07:23,119
I know I'm a liar, I admit it

533
01:07:23,375 --> 01:07:26,982
still, still Elma it hurts

534
01:07:27,463 --> 01:07:30,519
even though it's time to say goodbye

535
01:07:30,791 --> 01:07:36,543
I'll sing until the darkening night arrives
