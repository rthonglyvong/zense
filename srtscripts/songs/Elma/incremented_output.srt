550
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:41,737
I know I'm a liar, I admit it

551
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:45,553
still, still Elma it hurts

552
01:03:46,071 --> 01:03:49,249
even though it's time to say goodbye

553
01:03:49,479 --> 01:03:55,161
I'll sing until the darkening night arrives

554
01:04:10,824 --> 01:04:15,265
Me and Elma, in the morning sunlight shining through the trees

555
01:04:15,527 --> 01:04:18,345
are you still sleepy?

556
01:04:18,711 --> 01:04:24,137
as the early summer begins, we approach the forest of May

557
01:04:27,055 --> 01:04:31,881
Walking with the dew from the flowers on our faces

558
01:04:32,087 --> 01:04:34,993
see, they're like tear drops

559
01:04:35,255 --> 01:04:38,105
Let's yawn like this

560
01:04:38,391 --> 01:04:42,945
if you want we can even sit in a chair

561
01:04:43,551 --> 01:04:47,609
There's nothing that can't be forgiven

562
01:04:47,887 --> 01:04:51,881
you can become kinder

563
01:04:53,831 --> 01:05:03,201
Like this, in some far away country

564
01:05:04,255 --> 01:05:08,999
lying sprawled out in a shallow summer

565
01:05:10,199 --> 01:05:19,208
without shedding tears or saying words

566
01:05:20,623 --> 01:05:25,545
without simply knowing the deepness of the night

567
01:05:27,247 --> 01:05:30,881
I know I'm a liar, I admit it

568
01:05:31,183 --> 01:05:34,969
still, still Elma it hurts

569
01:05:35,343 --> 01:05:38,289
even though it's time to say goodbye

570
01:05:38,567 --> 01:05:44,625
I'll sing until the darkening night arrives

571
01:06:00,112 --> 01:06:07,866
if you don't see difficult or painful things you won't understand them

572
01:06:08,327 --> 01:06:11,1049
with your eyes closed you ran away

573
01:06:12,367 --> 01:06:15,1001
walking a moonlit path

574
01:06:16,503 --> 01:06:20,282
cramped rooms, cold nights

575
01:06:20,535 --> 01:06:24,410
sleepy afternoons, lonely mornings

576
01:06:24,878 --> 01:06:32,088
in the words of farewell, I'm looking at your face

577
01:06:37,343 --> 01:06:46,393
Like this, in some far away country

578
01:06:47,807 --> 01:06:53,073
lying sprawled out in a shallow summer

579
01:06:54,319 --> 01:07:03,609
without shedding tears or saying words

580
01:07:04,503 --> 01:07:09,329
simply looking at the blueness of the sky

581
01:07:12,727 --> 01:07:17,873
simply not knowing of the ending between us

582
01:07:19,527 --> 01:07:23,169
I know I'm a liar, I admit it

583
01:07:23,375 --> 01:07:26,1032
still, still Elma it hurts

584
01:07:27,463 --> 01:07:30,569
even though it's time to say goodbye

585
01:07:30,791 --> 01:07:36,593
I'll sing until the darkening night arrives
