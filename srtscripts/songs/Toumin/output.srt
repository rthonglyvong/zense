600
01:11:06,300 --> 01:11:09,723
In a rain-drenched playground, 

601
01:11:11,472 --> 01:11:15,379
I remembered yesterday’s fireworks,

602
01:11:16,404 --> 01:11:21,772
Your distracted face from that time, 

603
01:11:21,987 --> 01:11:27,788
and the scent of summer still on the wind.

604
01:11:48,988 --> 01:11:51,204
Fall comes, 

605
01:11:51,619 --> 01:11:53,541
winter comes,

606
01:11:53,604 --> 01:11:55,876
After we finished 

607
01:11:56,492 --> 01:11:58,972
our long slumber

608
01:11:59,580 --> 01:12:01,928
Riding the clouds, 

609
01:12:02,244 --> 01:12:04,315
riding the wind,

610
01:12:04,676 --> 01:12:07,536
Let’s go far away, 

611
01:12:08,324 --> 01:12:11,723
there’s nothing for us here.

612
01:12:33,635 --> 01:12:38,364
In a playground where flowers fluttered, 

613
01:12:39,155 --> 01:12:43,971
I remembered yesterday’s sunset,

614
01:12:44,852 --> 01:12:49,324
Your cold, transparent self from that time, 

615
01:12:49,667 --> 01:12:56,435
and summer still lingering on your cheeks.

616
01:13:17,032 --> 01:13:19,484
Spring comes,

617
01:13:20,032 --> 01:13:21,984
summer comes,

618
01:13:22,116 --> 01:13:24,507
When we awakened 

619
01:13:24,876 --> 01:13:26,872
from our deep slumber

620
01:13:27,980 --> 01:13:30,144
Becoming water, 

621
01:13:30,683 --> 01:13:32,675
becoming flowers

622
01:13:33,108 --> 01:13:35,356
Let’s gaze at the sky, 

623
01:13:36,667 --> 01:13:40,276
we don’t need anything like words.

624
01:13:43,356 --> 01:13:45,280
There’s no such thing as gods,

625
01:13:45,595 --> 01:13:48,239
And realizing our dreams is a lie,

626
01:13:48,485 --> 01:13:51,708
So let’s put a stop to work and school.

627
01:13:54,068 --> 01:13:56,508
If it’s natural to forget things,

628
01:13:56,668 --> 01:13:59,580
Don't create words for these memories

629
01:13:60,012 --> 01:14:03,436
Let’s seal our mouths so we don’t forget.

630
01:14:06,436 --> 01:14:08,499
I’ll wait for you, 

631
01:14:09,460 --> 01:14:11,267
as summer passes,

632
01:14:11,892 --> 01:14:14,211
Someday, when 

633
01:14:14,603 --> 01:14:16,300
we can see the end

634
01:14:17,684 --> 01:14:19,564
Riding the clouds, 

635
01:14:20,428 --> 01:14:22,580
riding the wind

636
01:14:23,027 --> 01:14:25,148
Like we’re sleeping, 

637
01:14:27,051 --> 01:14:28,428
just…

638
01:14:28,996 --> 01:14:30,340
Fall comes, 

639
01:14:31,252 --> 01:14:33,300
winter comes,

640
01:14:34,020 --> 01:14:36,492
After we finished 

641
01:14:37,236 --> 01:14:38,156
our long slumber

642
01:14:39,924 --> 01:14:41,484
Riding the clouds, 

643
01:14:42,411 --> 01:14:44,131
riding the wind,

644
01:14:44,835 --> 01:14:47,219
Let’s go far away,

645
01:14:48,388 --> 01:14:51,892
There’s nothing for us here.

646
01:14:59,095 --> 01:15:02,932
I want to live with you alone.

647
01:15:11,003 --> 01:15:15,091
I want to live with you alone.

648
01:15:22,184 --> 01:15:26,212
I want to live with you alone.
