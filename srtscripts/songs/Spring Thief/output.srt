450
00:52:35,700 --> 00:52:41,907
Emerging from the curve of the bridge, the sky’s blue slipped between the clouds

451
00:52:43,364 --> 00:52:49,267
Because of how hot it has recently been, I’ve been waiting for the wind to blow past me

452
00:52:50,883 --> 00:52:53,124
As I’m sitting in the shade of a tree

453
00:52:54,724 --> 00:52:56,707
Something lands on my cheek

454
00:52:58,412 --> 00:53:02,731
And as I look overhead, I see above me the blossoms chip off

455
00:53:05,811 --> 00:53:09,571
Akin to gently falling flowers, we forgot how to breathe ¹

456
00:53:09,852 --> 00:53:13,467
Even blinking is such a pain

457
00:53:13,747 --> 00:53:16,996
You know yourself that even today will turn to past the next day

458
00:53:17,700 --> 00:53:20,708
I’m just waiting for the wind to come

459
00:53:21,220 --> 00:53:24,891
And so as we forgot how to utter all words

460
00:53:25,107 --> 00:53:28,812
Even telling goodbye’s such a pain

461
00:53:29,067 --> 00:53:33,540
Just the image of flowers falling on a sunny day

462
00:53:33,860 --> 00:53:36,643
Makes it look like it’s spring’s take on a snow storm

463
00:53:52,747 --> 00:53:54,483
Meeting with you on the next day

464
00:53:56,355 --> 00:53:58,828
I see that not so many people are here viewing flowers

465
00:54:00,235 --> 00:54:02,332
The spring’s scent is leaving the air

466
00:54:03,900 --> 00:54:06,132
I wonder if this year as well summer will reach us

467
00:54:07,763 --> 00:54:14,292
Emerging from the curve of the bridge, your face peeked from the end of the road

468
00:54:15,635 --> 00:54:17,820
I wonder how much there is left

469
00:54:19,491 --> 00:54:21,596
How many more times will we be able to meet in this spring

470
00:54:23,155 --> 00:54:29,092
On a riverside hill, I sit in the shade of a tree

471
00:54:30,652 --> 00:54:36,555
Surrounded by blossoms, not different from yesterday

472
00:54:38,076 --> 00:54:41,756
Completely forgetting how to breathe in the air

473
00:54:42,060 --> 00:54:45,716
Even blinking for us's such a pain

474
00:54:46,020 --> 00:54:49,387
Right now this vile storm is taking all the blossoms in

475
00:54:49,875 --> 00:54:52,995
Just like a spring thief

476
00:54:53,307 --> 00:54:56,996
And all our time today has gone away with the wind

477
00:54:57,204 --> 00:55:00,908
Even standing is such a pain

478
00:55:01,108 --> 00:55:05,732
In the gaps between the blossoms, the sky's chipping off

479
00:55:05,964 --> 00:55:08,836
Spring’s snow storm still rages on

480
00:55:24,507 --> 00:55:26,779
Today again I’m going to see you

481
00:55:28,387 --> 00:55:30,564
Sitting in the shade of a tree

482
00:55:32,140 --> 00:55:34,468
A single sigh takes the stage

483
00:55:36,020 --> 00:55:38,324
The blossoms are no more

484
00:55:39,812 --> 00:55:42,180
Tomorrow again I’m about to see you

485
00:55:43,547 --> 00:55:45,947
The spring is nearing its end

486
00:55:47,380 --> 00:55:52,188
The falling time stays here in remnants of what we used to be

487
00:55:55,253 --> 00:55:58,515
When singing of love, there are never enough words

488
00:55:58,819 --> 00:56:02,387
Even rhyming them's a pain

489
00:56:02,684 --> 00:56:09,484
Can you even begin to describe the moment flowers start to bloom with such a thing?

490
00:56:09,964 --> 00:56:13,827
Akin to gently falling flowers, forgetting how to let out a voice

491
00:56:14,124 --> 00:56:17,764
Even blinking for us's such a pain

492
00:56:18,123 --> 00:56:20,628
Only we are here to watch the cherry blossoms

493
00:56:21,900 --> 00:56:25,580
Don’t chip them off just yet, spring’s snow storm

494
00:56:26,035 --> 00:56:28,500
There’s only that much left

495
00:56:29,307 --> 00:56:31,940
So little, that you can count them down

496
00:56:40,756 --> 00:56:44,332
Only two blossoms left

497
00:56:48,812 --> 00:56:51,412
Just one blossom left

498
00:56:56,476 --> 00:57:00,940
And now only leaves are up there, chipping off

499
00:57:01,227 --> 00:57:04,603
The spring has now met its end
