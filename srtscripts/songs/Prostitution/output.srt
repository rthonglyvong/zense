300
00:37:45,699 --> 00:37:47,860
It's alright, it's alright

301
00:37:48,331 --> 00:37:49,836
If you sleep it over, everything will straighten out one way or another

302
00:37:50,236 --> 00:37:52,947
What's the matter, why make that face?

303
00:37:53,292 --> 00:37:54,595
It doesn't really make a difference either way

304
00:37:56,036 --> 00:37:58,187
In vain I'm waiting for love in front of a train station

305
00:37:58,580 --> 00:38:00,499
I have nothing else to do after all

306
00:38:00,835 --> 00:38:03,811
Please explain to me the worth of dishonesty

307
00:38:05,675 --> 00:38:10,819
Don't say a word, forget about such things as love

308
00:38:11,316 --> 00:38:14,771
Tell me about everything, even what brings you pain

309
00:38:15,243 --> 00:38:21,267
If just one such dragonfly is enough, I would rather forget

310
00:38:21,491 --> 00:38:24,587
I can't listen to you spewing nothing but empty words

311
00:38:26,124 --> 00:38:26,988
Yet I don't want to say it

312
00:38:50,147 --> 00:38:50,795
It's alright, no matter how much you try to express yourself

313
00:38:51,347 --> 00:38:52,723
Words are never enough for you

314
00:38:53,115 --> 00:38:55,715
What's the matter, don't you get it?

315
00:38:55,988 --> 00:38:56,875
- This anguish

316
00:38:58,755 --> 00:39:01,060
In vain I'm waiting for love at your front door

317
00:39:01,443 --> 00:39:03,020
Trying to suppress my voice, I struggle for air

318
00:39:03,779 --> 00:39:06,947
Please teach me the meaning of regret

319
00:39:08,635 --> 00:39:13,380
If you can, please forget things like that heat haze and the events of today

320
00:39:13,772 --> 00:39:17,716
And please sing nothing but songs of simple sorrowful love

321
00:39:18,035 --> 00:39:23,972
I would rather you not say "For the finale, a single kiss is enough"

322
00:39:24,268 --> 00:39:27,579
I can't forget even your empty words

323
00:39:28,859 --> 00:39:29,859
I don't want to know the truth

324
00:39:53,428 --> 00:39:59,460
Someday you'll forget such things as that heat haze and the events of today, right? It hurts

325
00:40:02,843 --> 00:40:08,579
If that one hesitation is love, then I would rather be ignorant

326
00:40:08,891 --> 00:40:12,595
Let me hear even your empty words more and more

327
00:40:14,091 --> 00:40:18,979
Don't say a word, forget about such things as tomorrow

328
00:40:19,324 --> 00:40:23,155
No matter how many times, please tell me about even what brings you pain

329
00:40:23,540 --> 00:40:29,515
A single unsightly dragonfly is plenty, I want it so bad - I could be absorbed by it

330
00:40:29,795 --> 00:40:33,107
Let me hear even your empty words more and more

331
00:40:34,492 --> 00:40:36,420
I just want your love
