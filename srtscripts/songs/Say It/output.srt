153
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:10,663
Say it

154
00:23:31,296 --> 00:23:31,655
You see, 

155
00:23:33,447 --> 00:23:36,855
I actually realized already

156
00:23:37,871 --> 00:23:39,655
Look, about that thing you said

157
00:23:41,767 --> 00:23:42,599
I didn't feel like

158
00:23:43,983 --> 00:23:47,575
Thinking about it too much

159
00:23:48,375 --> 00:23:50,239
So I had forgotten about it, but

160
00:23:52,032 --> 00:23:56,248
Living blindly, recklessly, delusionly

161
00:23:56,887 --> 00:24:02,983
Impulsively, impatiently, negatively didn’t do me any good​

162
00:24:07,479 --> 00:24:07,927
I’m sure​

163
00:24:08,711 --> 00:24:12,351
That on the last day of my life, when I think of what’s gone before​

164
00:24:12,879 --> 00:24:16,407
All of it, all of it will be unspeakably precious, but​

165
00:24:17,311 --> 00:24:17,663
Ah,

166
00:24:18,271 --> 00:24:23,055
On that last day of my life, you won’t be there

167
00:24:23,464 --> 00:24:26,671
More, more, more​

168
00:24:27,335 --> 00:24:31,847
Say that more clearly​

169
00:24:52,711 --> 00:24:53,271
You see,

170
00:24:55,183 --> 00:24:58,463
I’m not sure how to tell you

171
00:24:59,272 --> 00:25:01,031
That the sky is blue

172
00:25:03,191 --> 00:25:03,823
Or what

173
00:25:05,639 --> 00:25:09,159
I’d have to do to make you understand

174
00:25:09,631 --> 00:25:11,775
That the clouds at night are high

175
00:25:13,223 --> 00:25:13,975
Say it

176
00:25:34,679 --> 00:25:35,775
You see, 

177
00:25:37,127 --> 00:25:40,560
I actually know

178
00:25:41,072 --> 00:25:43,152
That you’re already gone

179
00:25:45,119 --> 00:25:45,775
You see

180
00:25:47,831 --> 00:25:50,967
You'll probably just call me obstinate

181
00:25:51,919 --> 00:25:53,751
And I want to forget, but

182
00:25:56,023 --> 00:25:57,959
Say it more clearly

183
00:25:58,367 --> 00:26:00,463
Make a note so you won't forget it

184
00:26:00,863 --> 00:26:04,551
Let's meet tomorrow at ten on the train platform, or something like that

185
00:26:06,647 --> 00:26:08,359
Even if its petals scatter, a peony is still a flower

186
00:26:08,807 --> 00:26:10,854
Even if summer ends, the memories of it are still cherished

187
00:26:11,535 --> 00:26:14,839
Put it into words, give voice to it

188
00:26:16,607 --> 00:26:17,791
Say it

189
00:26:21,191 --> 00:26:26,199
And then if I could see you on the last day of my life

190
00:26:26,679 --> 00:26:27,263
I'm sure,

191
00:26:27,679 --> 00:26:31,271
Even on the last day of my life, that I'd sing of love

192
00:26:31,679 --> 00:26:35,615
Because you'd tell me none of it, none of it was in vain

193
00:26:36,136 --> 00:26:36,375
Ah,

194
00:26:37,055 --> 00:26:41,824
I still can't believe that on the last day of my life,

195
00:26:42,135 --> 00:26:44,014
You won't be here

196
00:26:44,751 --> 00:26:49,039
More, more, more, more

197
00:26:49,871 --> 00:26:54,303
More, more, more, you have to

198
00:26:54,927 --> 00:26:58,016
More, more, more, more

199
00:26:58,719 --> 00:26:59,415
Please,

200
00:27:00,215 --> 00:27:01,159
Say it,

201
00:27:01,703 --> 00:27:03,151
More clearly
