90
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:12,824
Words whitened to grey and have a color like cappuccino

91
00:12:15,559 --> 00:12:19,615
Don't bother with excuses, leave them by the window

92
00:12:23,871 --> 00:12:25,048
I can't count them all

93
00:12:43,848 --> 00:12:51,239
Heart whitened to grey has a color like cappuccino

94
00:12:53,887 --> 00:12:58,360
Don't bother with excuses, let's gulp down the cappuccino

95
00:12:59,248 --> 00:13:00,687
And pretend to be foolish

96
00:13:02,416 --> 00:13:06,334
As if reluctant, the rain flows

97
00:13:06,839 --> 00:13:11,287
As we drown in the flowers storming us

98
00:13:11,727 --> 00:13:16,504
These memories I keep so that you won't fade away

99
00:13:16,792 --> 00:13:25,455
Please, please, please so you won't overflow

100
00:13:44,455 --> 00:13:48,688
A shore waiting for waves in a crimson sunset

101
00:13:49,888 --> 00:13:51,312
Reflecting on the windows

102
00:13:54,272 --> 00:13:56,608
An august in Visby,

103
00:13:56,967 --> 00:14:01,408
I waited in vain for the sea to roar with the breeze remaining

104
00:14:02,903 --> 00:14:08,344
The whiteness of the flower that swam in summer, the night rain

105
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:11,824
Drowning in the flowing night

106
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:16,679
A flower that nobody can let fade

107
00:14:17,119 --> 00:14:25,712
Please, please, please place it inside my chest

108
00:14:44,655 --> 00:14:46,016
Something's been wrong for a long time

109
00:14:46,424 --> 00:14:48,807
I just wanted to be told a way to live

110
00:14:49,359 --> 00:14:52,592
I no longer have anything I can pay you back with

111
00:14:54,399 --> 00:14:58,600
If you can't answer, just one word will do

112
00:14:59,048 --> 00:14:59,744
I don't understand

113
00:15:00,296 --> 00:15:02,640
I really don't understand

114
00:15:08,416 --> 00:15:12,552
As if reluctant, the rain flows

115
00:15:12,968 --> 00:15:17,440
As we drown in the flowers storming us

116
00:15:17,903 --> 00:15:22,503
The poem I'm writing so you won't fade

117
00:15:23,055 --> 00:15:31,536
Please, please, please so I won't forget

118
00:15:32,031 --> 00:15:36,520
Yet another summer comes to an end,

119
00:15:36,727 --> 00:15:38,496
Keeping this one flower close to my chest with tears escaping from behind my eyelids

120
00:15:39,751 --> 00:15:45,927
This poem, made so you won't fade away

121
00:15:47,328 --> 00:15:53,239
Please, please so you won't overflow
