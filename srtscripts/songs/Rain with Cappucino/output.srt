90
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:13,635
Words whitened to grey and have a color like cappuccino

91
00:12:16,179 --> 00:12:20,139
Don't bother with excuses, leave them by the window

92
00:12:24,403 --> 00:12:25,539
I can't count them all

93
00:12:44,171 --> 00:12:51,660
Heart whitened to grey has a color like cappuccino

94
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:58,595
Don't bother with excuses, let's gulp down the cappuccino

95
00:12:59,715 --> 00:13:01,171
And pretend to be foolish

96
00:13:02,899 --> 00:13:07,116
As if reluctant, the rain flows

97
00:13:07,435 --> 00:13:11,915
As we drown in the flowers storming us

98
00:13:12,243 --> 00:13:16,828
These memories I keep so that you won't fade away

99
00:13:17,268 --> 00:13:25,676
Please, please, please so you won't overflow

100
00:13:44,811 --> 00:13:49,187
A shore waiting for waves in a crimson sunset

101
00:13:50,379 --> 00:13:51,452
Reflecting on the windows

102
00:13:54,795 --> 00:13:57,027
An august in Visby,

103
00:13:57,548 --> 00:14:01,891
I waited in vain for the sea to roar with the breeze remaining

104
00:14:03,539 --> 00:14:08,851
The whiteness of the flower that swam in summer, the night rain

105
00:14:09,491 --> 00:14:12,292
Drowning in the flowing night

106
00:14:12,844 --> 00:14:17,132
A flower that nobody can let fade

107
00:14:17,756 --> 00:14:26,315
Please, please, please place it inside my chest

108
00:14:45,147 --> 00:14:46,555
Something's been wrong for a long time

109
00:14:46,987 --> 00:14:49,411
I just wanted to be told a way to live

110
00:14:49,892 --> 00:14:53,163
I no longer have anything I can pay you back with

111
00:14:54,899 --> 00:14:59,052
If you can't answer, just one word will do

112
00:14:59,444 --> 00:15:00,779
I don't understand

113
00:15:01,219 --> 00:15:02,835
I really don't understand

114
00:15:08, 595 --> 00:15:13,244
As if reluctant, the rain flows

115
00:15:13,699 --> 00:15:18,060
As we drown in the flowers storming us

116
00:15:19,172 --> 00:15:22,643
The poem I'm writing so you won't fade

117
00:15:23,476 --> 00:15:31,827
Please, please, please so I won't forget

118
00:15:32,475 --> 00:15:36,540
Yet another summer comes to an end,

119
00:15:37,123 --> 00:15:39,619
Keeping this one flower close to my chest with tears escaping from behind my eyelids

120
00:15:40,259 --> 00:15:44,572
This poem, made so you won't fade away

121
00:15:47,819 --> 00:15:53,683
Please, please so you won't overflow
