1
00:02:37,666 --> 00:02:39,810
The scenery doesn’t change; 

2
00:02:40,089 --> 00:02:43,530
on a faded afternoon I’m lying in the deep indigo 

3
00:02:43,698 --> 00:02:47,354
beneath the overpass

4
00:02:49,386 --> 00:02:51,410
I hear a single clap 

5
00:02:51,586 --> 00:02:54,449
for my blank-page life

6
00:02:54,946 --> 00:03:01,553
I was singing about my own emptiness today, as usual

7
00:03:21,121 --> 00:03:22,945
So things wouldn’t change,

8
00:03:23,113 --> 00:03:25,825
I wrote a story starring you 

9
00:03:26,090 --> 00:03:29,561
in my notebook

10
00:03:31,377 --> 00:03:33,073
My gas and water being cut off, 

11
00:03:33,466 --> 00:03:36,225
society, and the news are all someone else’s problem

12
00:03:36,529 --> 00:03:38,642
Look, 

13
00:03:38,897 --> 00:03:40,346
my life is like ink

14
00:03:40,825 --> 00:03:51,465
The dream I had when I was young gets closer to its expiration date 

15
00:03:52,426 --> 00:03:53,825
as I get older

16
00:03:54,345 --> 00:03:58,873
Though I just, I just look up at the clouds

17
00:03:59,177 --> 00:04:04,049
As usual, they flow through my field of vision

18
00:04:04,401 --> 00:04:09,233
In the distant night sky I looked up at, flowers swam

19
00:04:09,433 --> 00:04:13,185
So many that it could be mistaken for spring

20
00:04:13,498 --> 00:04:18,401
As if I’d just lost sight of you

21
00:04:38,057 --> 00:04:40,665
I looked down so I wouldn’t trip

22
00:04:40,905 --> 00:04:42,737
Life is made of 

23
00:04:42,913 --> 00:04:46,337
nothing but compromises

24
00:04:48,025 --> 00:04:52,665
I don’t believe in hearts or fate or love songs or life

25
00:04:53,113 --> 00:04:56,073
After all, if you can’t sell something it has no value

26
00:04:57,017 --> 00:05:01,497
I intentionally discarded the present I dreamed of, 

27
00:05:01,906 --> 00:05:07,753
and now I’m lying here waiting for 

28
00:05:08,569 --> 00:05:10,017
its expiration date

29
00:05:10,450 --> 00:05:15,201
Behind my eyelids, I just, I just saw

30
00:05:15,457 --> 00:05:20,330
An imagined, distant vision of you

31
00:05:20,649 --> 00:05:25,209
In my notebook, flowers swim in the corner of a faded night

32
00:05:25,505 --> 00:05:29,657
One more is in my eye

33
00:05:30,777 --> 00:05:33,601
Life is just one compromise after another

34
00:05:33,761 --> 00:05:35,601
I learned that pretty fast

35
00:05:35,809 --> 00:05:38,265
Elma, it’s you

36
00:05:38,657 --> 00:05:41,009
You alone are my music

37
00:05:41,553 --> 00:05:43,737
There are only eighty more characters in this song

38
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:45,457
Because maybe the only value of a life 

39
00:05:46,129 --> 00:05:51,994
is in the way it ends

40
00:05:55,793 --> 00:06:00,369
I just, I just picture you

41
00:06:00,577 --> 00:06:05,258
As even the indigo filling my vision is blurred

42
00:06:05,658 --> 00:06:10,473
In the distant sky I looked up at, flowers swam

43
00:06:10,746 --> 00:06:15,089
Deep indigo covers my eyes

44
00:06:15,473 --> 00:06:19,281
It’s just, it’s just…

45
00:06:25,922 --> 00:06:31,921
In the distant sky I looked up at, you are cooling off

46
00:06:35,426 --> 00:06:39,233
As if you were just swimming in the night
