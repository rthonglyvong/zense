1
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:40,756
The scenery doesn’t change; on a faded afternoon

2
00:02:41,443 --> 00:02:46,892
I’m lying in the deep indigo beneath the overpass

3
00:02:49,155 --> 00:02:53,860
I hear a single clap for my blank-page life

4
00:02:54,732 --> 00:03:00,491
I was singing about my own emptiness today, as usual

5
00:03:20,979 --> 00:03:22,003
So things wouldn’t change,

6
00:03:22,827 --> 00:03:29,283
I wrote a story starring you in my notebook

7
00:03:31,307 --> 00:03:36,691
My gas and water being cut off, society, and the news are all someone else’s problem

8
00:03:37,883 --> 00:03:39,620
Look, my life is like ink

9
00:03:40,387 --> 00:03:53,228
The dream I had when I was young gets closer to its expiration date as I get older

10
00:03:53,587 --> 00:03:58,539
Though I just, I just look up at the clouds

11
00:03:58,908 --> 00:04:03,435
As usual, they flow through my field of vision

12
00:04:04,275 --> 00:04:08,627
In the distant night sky I looked up at, flowers swam

13
00:04:09,251 --> 00:04:12,891
So many that it could be mistaken for spring

14
00:04:13,396 --> 00:04:17,820
As if I’d just lost sight of you

15
00:04:37,708 --> 00:04:40,315
I looked down so I wouldn’t trip

16
00:04:40,916 --> 00:04:45,467
Life is made of nothing but compromises

17
00:04:47,884 --> 00:04:52,204
I don’t believe in hearts or fate or love songs or life

18
00:04:52,868 --> 00:04:55,388
After all, if you can’t sell something it has no value

19
00:04:56,747 --> 00:05:09,708
I intentionally discarded the present I dreamed of, and now I’m lying here waiting for its expiration date

20
00:05:10,075 --> 00:05:14,803
Behind my eyelids, I just, I just saw

21
00:05:15,172 --> 00:05:19,532
An imagined, distant vision of you

22
00:05:20,348 --> 00:05:24,707
In my notebook, flowers swim in the corner of a faded night

23
00:05:25,540 --> 00:05:28,267
One more is in my eye

24
00:05:30,468 --> 00:05:33,075
Life is just one compromise after another

25
00:05:33,315 --> 00:05:35,451
I learned that pretty fast

26
00:05:35,708 --> 00:05:36,891
Elma, it’s you

27
00:05:38,515 --> 00:05:40,283
You alone are my music

28
00:05:41,388 --> 00:05:43,811
There are only eighty more characters in this song

29
00:05:44,311 --> 00:05:50,892
Because maybe the only value of a life is in the way it ends

30
00:05:55,668 --> 00:05:59,851
I just, I just picture you

31
00:06:00,851 --> 00:06:04,451
As even the indigo filling my vision is blurred

32
00:06:05,380 --> 00:06:09,700
In the distant sky I looked up at, flowers swam

33
00:06:10,332 --> 00:06:13,659
Deep indigo covers my eyes

34
00:06:15,187 --> 00:06:18,996
It’s just, it’s just…

35
00:06:25,716 --> 00:06:30,283
In the distant sky I looked up at, you are cooling off

36
00:06:35,172 --> 00:06:38,923
As if you were just swimming in the night
