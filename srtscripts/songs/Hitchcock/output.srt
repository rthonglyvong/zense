245
00:32:19,500 --> 00:32:24,212
“Why does the scent of the rain make me feel nostalgic?

246
00:32:25,179 --> 00:32:29,931
Why does my heart clamor as summer approaches?

247
00:32:30,868 --> 00:32:35,716
Why do I cry when people laugh at me?

248
00:32:36,691 --> 00:32:41,340
Is it all right to think that even so I’ll be rewarded someday?”

249
00:32:42,092 --> 00:32:44,708
With the word “goodbye”

250
00:32:44,988 --> 00:32:47,372
tearing so much at my chest,

251
00:32:47,732 --> 00:32:52,731
I was standing still for just a few moments

252
00:32:53,244 --> 00:32:55,420
at sunset

253
00:32:56,243 --> 00:32:58,147
“Teacher, I want to talk about my life.

254
00:32:58,699 --> 00:33:01,227
What should I do from now on?

255
00:33:01,540 --> 00:33:05,964
Are you just going to tell me ‘no one knows that’ or something?

256
00:33:06,180 --> 00:33:07,012
Look,

257
00:33:07,444 --> 00:33:09,627
it’s not that I want to suffer.

258
00:33:10,036 --> 00:33:13,364
I just want to live without doing anything.

259
00:33:13,595 --> 00:33:16,397
Is it selfish to just want to look at the blue sky?”

260
00:33:31,004 --> 00:33:35,460
“Why do I lie even though it makes my heart ache?

261
00:33:36,363 --> 00:33:41,117
Why do only bad people prosper?

262
00:33:42,108 --> 00:33:47,147
Why is it that the character for ‘happiness’(幸) includes the ‘money’(￥)sign?

263
00:33:47,516 --> 00:33:52,980
Is it on purpose that leaving out a single stroke turns it into the character for ‘pain’(辛)?”

264
00:33:53,363 --> 00:33:55,964
With a price sticker saying “youth”

265
00:33:56,275 --> 00:33:58,644
stuck to my back

266
00:33:59,059 --> 00:34:03,844
I was hoping in some way for

267
00:34:05,108 --> 00:34:06,939
Hitchcock-like suspense

268
00:34:07,355 --> 00:34:09,628
“Teacher, I don’t care.

269
00:34:10,036 --> 00:34:12,300
Just going on living causes me pain.

270
00:34:13,028 --> 00:34:17,119
Neither Nietzche nor Freud wrote about how to fill this hole.

271
00:34:17,708 --> 00:34:18,184
I just

272
00:34:19,424 --> 00:34:21,452
want to close my eyes in the scent of summer,

273
00:34:21,571 --> 00:34:23,803
And sketch out the height of the clouds with my fingers.

274
00:34:24,244 --> 00:34:27,708
Is it selfish to just want to relive memories?”

275
00:34:38,667 --> 00:34:43,756
“A story where people die dramatically will sell, won’t it?

276
00:34:44,380 --> 00:34:49,060
I’ve come to hate that even the moment that a flower’s petals fall has a price on it.

277
00:34:50,108 --> 00:34:53,459
What was your dream, Teacher?

278
00:34:55,667 --> 00:34:59,828
Did you forget it when you became an adult?”

279
00:35:01,315 --> 00:35:03,460
"Teacher, I want to talk about my life.

280
00:35:04,132 --> 00:35:06,548
What should I do from now on?

281
00:35:07,148 --> 00:35:11,580
‘Tears make people stronger’ was nothing but sophism

282
00:35:11,971 --> 00:35:12,419
Yes,

283
00:35:12,884 --> 00:35:15,539
it’s not that I don’t care what happens to me,

284
00:35:15,860 --> 00:35:17,928
it’s just that reality is flickering,

285
00:35:18,476 --> 00:35:19,844
And summer is far away.

286
00:35:21,371 --> 00:35:23,532
Is this really all right?

287
00:35:24,204 --> 00:35:26,684
Can I go on living like this?

288
00:35:27,084 --> 00:35:31,612
Are you just going to tell me ‘only you can answer that’ or something?

289
00:35:31,852 --> 00:35:32,523
I just

290
00:35:32,836 --> 00:35:35,299
Want to close my eyes to the scent of summer.

291
00:35:35,756 --> 00:35:37,924
I want to feel the wind always.

292
00:35:38,451 --> 00:35:42,027
Is it selfish to just want to look at the blue sky?”

293
00:35:44,387 --> 00:35:47,892
Is it selfish if I just want to know you?
