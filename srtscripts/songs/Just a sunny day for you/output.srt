202
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,744
The moon that floated in the night like a jelly fish

203
00:27:45,064 --> 00:27:49,072
Has split open

204
00:27:49,432 --> 00:27:53,527
When I glance at someone’s back at the bus stop

205
00:27:54,271 --> 00:27:58,640
You, as you were that summer, are in my head

206
00:28:06,784 --> 00:28:06,967
Only

207
00:28:14,752 --> 00:28:17,328
Torii gates, dried-out clouds;

208
00:28:18,768 --> 00:28:22,776
the scent of summer strokes my cheek

209
00:28:23,271 --> 00:28:25,751
Until I become an adult,

210
00:28:26,479 --> 00:28:27,104
look,

211
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:29,640
I’ll keep standing on tiptoe to make myself taller

212
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:34,416
Tired out from playing,

213
00:28:35,584 --> 00:28:39,576
behind the bus stop I could even see the sky

214
00:28:39,888 --> 00:28:43,840
Even if the summer comes to an end soon

215
00:28:44,128 --> 00:28:47,969
I’ll definitely, definitely remember

216
00:28:48,767 --> 00:28:52,872
Becoming an adult without being able to catch up

217
00:28:53,167 --> 00:28:56,591
Night blooms in your pocket

218
00:28:56,944 --> 00:29:01,632
If I can’t put it into words I’ll be alone

219
00:29:01,863 --> 00:29:04,472
But that’s all right,

220
00:29:04,664 --> 00:29:06,719
I’ve already resigned myself to it

221
00:29:09,705 --> 00:29:10,447
Only

222
00:29:26,689 --> 00:29:29,256
A summer day, dried-out clouds,

223
00:29:30,687 --> 00:29:34,616
Nanking cherry trees, a rusted stoplight

224
00:29:34,936 --> 00:29:41,959
In my memories, it always smells like summer

225
00:29:43,344 --> 00:29:46,408
Photographs are just scraps of paper

226
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:51,624
And memories are nothing but garbage

227
00:29:51,928 --> 00:29:59,080
Because I didn’t understand that, I kept my mouth shut

228
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:09,032
In my memory, you rest forever on the single stone in a summer field*

229
00:30:09,543 --> 00:30:13,719
Becoming an adult while looking down

230
00:30:13,991 --> 00:30:17,759
I can’t catch up, it’s just a sunny day for you

231
00:30:18,064 --> 00:30:22,032
Unable to put things into words, we climbed the hill

232
00:30:22,513 --> 00:30:24,760
In our shadows,

233
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,359
night is blooming

234
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:49,352
We’ve become adults

235
00:30:50,927 --> 00:30:51,840
while looking down

236
00:30:52,399 --> 00:30:55,312
Clap your hands how you like

237
00:30:56,216 --> 00:31:00,319
Climbing the road up the hill at sunset

238
00:31:00,616 --> 00:31:02,896
Our shadows…

239
00:31:04,159 --> 00:31:08,967
Becoming an adult without being able to catch up

240
00:31:09,255 --> 00:31:13,200
Night blooms in your pocket

241
00:31:13,544 --> 00:31:17,592
Even if we can’t put it into words, we are one**

242
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:21,023
That’s enough, I think

243
00:31:22,016 --> 00:31:27,136
I’m only chewing over memories

244
00:31:34,136 --> 00:31:34,967
of you
